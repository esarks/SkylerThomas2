### Chapter 13: Devil's On The Run
**Based on:** "Devil's On The Run III (Remix)" (Devotional and Song)

**Opening Scene (2-3 pages):**

It's 3 AM and you're wide awake. Again.

The accusations are playing on repeat in your mind like a broken record: *You're not really forgiven. God's still angry. You've failed too many times. You'll never be free. This sin is too big.*

You know these voices. You've heard them before. They always show up in the dark, in the quiet, when you're too tired to fight back effectively.

And tonight, they feel true.

You've been doing well—walking in the rhythms, sending roots deep, seeing your story within God's story, trusting that nothing's wasted. But now, in the middle of the night, all that progress feels fragile. One accusation away from crumbling.

The enemy whispers: *See? You haven't really changed. This is who you are. This is who you'll always be.*

You sit up in bed, exhausted. Not from lack of sleep, but from this constant battle. This relentless warfare that feels like hand-to-hand combat in the dark.

And then, almost without thinking, you whisper something you've been learning: "Jesus, the cross. The cross settles this."

The accusations don't stop immediately. But something shifts. Because you're remembering something crucial: this isn't a battle for victory. It's a battle from victory.

The war is already over. The enemy has already been defeated. You're not fighting to win—you're enforcing the win that's already been won.

You think of Colossians 2:15: "Having disarmed the powers and authorities, he made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them by the cross."

Disarmed. Public spectacle. Triumphed.

Past tense. Done. Finished.

The devil is on the run. Not because you're strong. Because Christ is victorious.

And you—standing in Christ's victory—don't have to fight for freedom. You just have to stand in the freedom that's already yours.

**The Geography of Spiritual Warfare (2 pages):**

Let's be honest about what spiritual warfare feels like. Because if you've been in the fight, you know it's not theoretical. It's visceral.

Spiritual warfare feels like:
- **Accusations that feel true.** "You're not really forgiven. God's still angry. You've failed too many times."
- **Temptations perfectly tailored to your weaknesses.** The enemy knows where you're vulnerable.
- **Despair that whispers "give up."** What's the point? You'll never change. This is who you are.
- **Isolation.** The lie that you're alone. That no one else struggles like this. That if people knew, they'd reject you.
- **Confusion.** Feeling like you can't tell God's voice from the enemy's lies from your own thoughts.

But here's the shift: spiritual warfare from victory feels different.

When you're fighting from victory instead of for victory, the battle changes:
- **Accusations lose their power.** Not because they stop coming, but because you know they're lies. The cross settles it.
- **Temptations don't define you.** You're not your struggles. You're beloved. The temptation is an attack, not an identity.
- **Despair has no ground.** Hope is anchored in Christ's finished work, not your performance.
- **Isolation breaks.** You're part of a body. Connected. Not alone.
- **Truth becomes clear.** God's voice sounds like grace. The enemy's voice sounds like accusation. And you're learning the difference.

The battlefield is still real. The enemy still attacks. But you're not desperately fighting for freedom anymore.

You're standing in freedom. Enforcing victory. Resisting from rest.

---

**Key Themes (3-4 pages):**

**1. Fighting From Victory, Not For Victory**

This is the fundamental shift. And it changes everything.

When you're fighting for victory, every battle feels desperate. Every temptation is a potential defeat. Every accusation carries the weight of judgment. You're trying to earn something, prove something, secure something through your effort.

But when you're fighting from victory, the pressure's off. You're not trying to earn freedom—you're protecting freedom that's already yours. You're not hoping to overcome—you're standing in the overcoming power of Christ.

James 4:7: "Resist the devil, and he will flee from you."

Notice what it doesn't say. It doesn't say "fight the devil until you're exhausted, and maybe he'll leave."

It says resist, and he will flee. Automatic. Guaranteed. The fleeing isn't something you make happen—it's the result of your positioning.

You resist, and he runs. Every time.

Why? Because he's already defeated. And he knows it.

You're not fighting to win. Christ won. You're enforcing that win. Standing in that victory. And when you do, the enemy has no choice but to flee.

**2. The Lies of the Enemy vs. The Truth of Grace**

The devil's primary weapon isn't force—it's deception. He can't take your salvation. He can't reverse what Christ has done. But he can lie to you about it.

And if he can get you to believe the lies, he can render you ineffective.

His strategy is always the same: make you doubt who you are in Christ.

*"You're not really forgiven."*
*"God is still angry with you."*
*"You've failed too many times."*
*"You'll never be free."*
*"This sin is too big for grace."*

Lies. All of them. But lies that feel true when you're in the swamp, when you're struggling, when you can't see clearly.

The antidote is truth. Not just knowing it intellectually, but anchoring your identity in it.

You are forgiven—completely, fully, eternally (1 John 1:9).
God is not angry with you—His wrath was satisfied at the cross (Romans 5:1).
Your failures don't define you—Christ's righteousness does (2 Corinthians 5:21).
You are free—the chains are broken, the prison door is open (John 8:36).
No sin is too big for grace—grace is bigger than all of them combined (Romans 5:20).

When you stand in these truths, the lies lose their power. The accusations fall flat. The enemy has nothing to work with.

Because truth always defeats lies. And grace always trumps accusation.

**3. Colossians 2:15 – The Public Spectacle**

One of the most powerful verses about spiritual warfare is Colossians 2:15:

> "And having disarmed the powers and authorities, he made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them by the cross."

This is the picture: Jesus on the cross, seemingly defeated. The enemy celebrating. But in that moment of apparent defeat, Jesus is actually stripping the enemy of every weapon, every claim, every authority.

And then—resurrection. The ultimate reversal. Death swallowed up in victory. The grave defeated. Satan disarmed. A public spectacle made of all the powers of darkness.

Disarmed. Every weapon the enemy had—sin, death, condemnation, accusation—was stripped away. He has no legitimate claim. No legal ground. No authority.

Public spectacle. The victory wasn't secret or private. It was public. Visible. Undeniable. The powers of darkness were put on display—defeated, humiliated, powerless.

Triumphing. This is the language of a victory parade. Jesus didn't just win—He celebrated. The cross wasn't Plan B. It was the plan. And it worked perfectly.

This is why the devil is on the run. He has no authority anymore. His power was stripped at the cross. His claims were nullified in the resurrection. All he has left are lies and fear—and both crumble in the presence of truth and faith.

**4. The Danger of Giving the Enemy Too Much Credit**

There's a danger on the other side of spiritual warfare: giving the devil too much credit. Making him seem more powerful than he is. Living in constant fear of his schemes.

But the truth is, the devil is a defeated foe. He's on a leash. His time is limited. His power is broken. And he has no authority over those who are in Christ.

This doesn't mean we ignore spiritual warfare. It means we engage it from the right posture—not fear, but confidence. Not paranoia, but awareness. Not obsession with the enemy, but focus on Christ.

Some Christians see a demon behind every bush. Others deny the reality of spiritual warfare altogether. The truth is in the middle: the enemy is real, but he's already defeated.

We need to be aware, but not afraid. Alert, but not anxious. Resisting, but resting in Christ's victory.

The devil is on the run. That's the truth. But don't spend your life looking over your shoulder for him.

Keep your eyes on Jesus. Stand firm in truth. And when the enemy shows up with his lies and accusations, resist him with confidence—knowing that he has no choice but to flee.

**5. Walking in Freedom, Not Just Fighting for It**

The ultimate goal of understanding spiritual warfare isn't just to fight better—it's to walk in freedom. To live in the victory that Christ has won. To stop constantly battling and start consistently abiding.

Too many Christians spend their entire lives in spiritual warfare mode—always fighting, always resisting, always on guard. And while vigilance is important, it's not the whole picture.

The whole picture is this: Christ has set you free. The chains are broken. The prison door is open. The devil is defeated.

Your job isn't to keep fighting for that freedom. It's to walk in it. To live from it. To let it shape how you think, how you respond, how you engage with life.

Galatians 5:1: "It is for freedom that Christ has set us free. Stand firm, then, and do not let yourselves be burdened again by a yoke of slavery."

Stand firm in freedom. Don't go back to slavery. Don't pick up chains that Christ has already broken. Don't believe lies that Christ has already exposed as false.

The devil is on the run. And you're free to live like it.

**Biblical Parallels (2-3 pages):**

**Jesus' Temptation in the Wilderness (Matthew 4:1-11)**

After His baptism, Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil. Three temptations. Three lies designed to make Jesus doubt His identity and His mission.

*"If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become bread."*
*"If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down from the temple."*
*"All this I will give you if you will bow down and worship me."*

Notice the pattern: the devil attacks identity ("If you are...") and tries to offer shortcuts to what God has already promised.

Jesus' response? Scripture. Truth. Every single time.

"It is written..."
"It is also written..."
"Away from me, Satan! For it is written..."

And the result? The devil left him. Fled. Ran.

This is the pattern for every believer. The enemy will attack your identity in Christ. He'll offer shortcuts. He'll tempt you to doubt God's promises.

Your response? Stand on truth. Speak Scripture. Resist with confidence.

And he will flee. Just like he fled from Jesus.

**Peter Sinking (Matthew 14:22-33)**

Peter steps out of the boat, walking on water toward Jesus. For a moment, he's doing the impossible.

Then he sees the wind, feels the waves, remembers how crazy this is—and he starts to sink.

And he cries out: "Lord, save me!"

Three words. Not a theological treatise. Not a confession of unworthiness. Just a desperate cry.

And immediately—not after Peter proved himself, not after Peter had a better attitude, not after Peter deserved it—immediately, Jesus reached out and caught him.

That's the pattern. Not "get yourself together and then call on Jesus." But "call on Jesus from the middle of your sinking."

The enemy wants you to think you have to fix yourself before God will help you. But Jesus reaches out immediately when you cry out.

**The Fall of Satan (Revelation 12:7-12)**

Revelation gives us a cosmic perspective on spiritual warfare:

> "Then war broke out in heaven... But he was not strong enough, and they lost their place in heaven. The great dragon was hurled down—that ancient serpent called the devil, or Satan... The accuser of our brothers and sisters, who accuses them before our God day and night, has been hurled down."
>
> — Revelation 12:7-10

The devil was cast down. Defeated. Expelled from heaven.

And the response of heaven? "Now have come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Messiah."

The accuser is cast down. His accusations no longer stand. His authority is revoked. The victory is complete.

And the call to believers?

> "They triumphed over him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony; they did not love their lives so much as to shrink from death."
>
> — Revelation 12:11

You overcome by the blood of the Lamb (Christ's finished work) and the word of your testimony (standing in truth).

Christ's victory + your faith = the devil on the run.

**Theological Anchor (2 pages):**

**Colossians 2:13-15** - "And having disarmed the powers and authorities, he made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them by the cross."

The cross is the turning point of all spiritual warfare. What looked like defeat was actually the decisive victory.

Jesus didn't just survive the enemy's attack—He dismantled it.

**Disarmed.** Every weapon the enemy had—sin, death, condemnation, accusation—was stripped away. He has no legitimate claim. No legal ground. No authority.

**Public spectacle.** The victory wasn't secret or private. It was public. Visible. Undeniable. The powers of darkness were put on display—defeated, humiliated, powerless.

**Triumphing.** This is the language of a victory parade. Jesus didn't just win—He celebrated. The cross wasn't Plan B. It was the plan. And it worked perfectly.

This is the theological foundation for "the devil is on the run." Not wishful thinking. Not positive confession. Not spiritual bravado.

Reality. Accomplished fact. The cross changed everything.

Ephesians 6:10-11: "Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power. Put on the full armor of God, so that you can take your stand against the devil's schemes."

Notice: you're strong in the Lord, not in yourself. The armor is God's armor, not your own. And the call is to stand, not to fight for ground you don't have.

You're holding ground that's already been won. Standing in victory that's already been secured. Resisting an enemy who's already been defeated.

This is spiritual warfare from rest. From confidence. From the unforced rhythms of grace.

The devil is on the run. Not because you're strong, but because Christ is victorious.

And in Him, you share that victory.

**The Wayfarer Moment (1-2 pages):**

**The shift from fighting for victory to fighting from victory changed everything for me.**

For years, I felt like I was barely holding on. Every temptation was a potential defeat. Every accusation felt true. Every battle left me exhausted, wondering if I'd survive the next one.

I was fighting for victory—trying to earn it, prove it, secure it through my effort and willpower.

But I kept losing. Or at best, barely winning. And the exhaustion was crushing.

Then I encountered Colossians 2:15. "Having disarmed the powers and authorities, he made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them by the cross."

Wait. The enemy is already disarmed? Already defeated? Already on the run?

It didn't feel that way. It felt like he was winning. Gaining ground. Stealing my peace, my joy, my confidence.

But the truth wasn't about how it felt. It was about what Christ accomplished.

And slowly—so slowly—I began to shift. From fighting for victory to fighting from victory. From desperation to confidence. From fear to faith.

I started speaking truth to the lies. Not hoping the truth would work, but knowing it would.

*"You say I'm not forgiven. But Scripture says I am—completely, fully, eternally."*
*"You say God is angry with me. But Scripture says His wrath was satisfied at the cross."*
*"You say I'll never be free. But Scripture says whom the Son sets free is free indeed."*

And every time I stood on truth, the lies lost their power. The accusations fell flat. The enemy fled.

Not because I was strong. But because I was standing on ground he couldn't touch.

I'm still learning this. Still growing in it. There are days when the lies feel louder than the truth. Days when I forget that the victory is already won.

But more and more, I'm living from victory instead of for it. Resisting from rest instead of from fear. Standing in confidence because Christ has already triumphed.

The devil is on the run. And I'm learning to live in the freedom of that reality.

**Song Integration (2-3 pages):**

**Song: "Devil's On The Run"**

**[Verse 1]**
Devil on the run
He's a wicked beast
Tried to take me down
But he lost his feast
He kicked me hard
Left me buried deep
But I rose in grace
While he lost his keep

**[Verse 2]**
In my darkest night
I forgot the gift I had
He pulled me low
Told me lies and made me mad
But even in the pit
Jesus called my name
Now I walk in light
I'm not the same

**[Pre-Chorus]**
Don't be fooled
By the snake in the weeds
He don't care
'Bout your hope or your needs
He can't give life
Only takes what you earn
He'll torch it all
Just to watch it burn

**[Chorus]**
Now I rise, now I run
By the power of the Son
But the Devil is a liar
He's Done!!
Ain't no grace where he's from
Tried to steal, tried to kill
But my soul he couldn't take
Devil's on the run
'Cause I'm saved by grace

**[Verse 3]**
Chains are gone
Yeah, the stone rolled back
He lost the war
On a bloodstained track
Truth is fire
And the lie won't stand
I'm a child of God
With a sword in my hand

**[Chorus – repeat]**
Now I rise, now I run
By the power of the Son
But the Devil is a liar
He's Done!!
Ain't no grace where he's from
Tried to steal, tried to kill
But my soul he couldn't take
Devil's on the run
'Cause I'm saved by grace

**[Bridge – Breakdown / Call & Response]**
Oh the blood!
Oh the Lamb!
Crushed the devil
With a mighty hand
Ain't no grave!
Gonna hold me down!
I've been bought
And I wear the crown
You can growl
You can scream
But you can't run
From the King
Devil's on the run—
He lost everything

**[Final Chorus – Tag out strong]**
Now I rise, now I run
By the power of the Son
But the Devil is a liar
He's Done!!
Ain't no grace where he's from
Tried to steal, tried to kill
But my soul he couldn't take
Devil's on the run
Yeah, the devil's on the run
Jesus won — and I'm saved by grace

**The Story Behind the Song:**

I wrote this song in the middle of one of the fiercest spiritual battles I've ever faced.

The accusations were relentless. Day and night. "You're not really changed. This is who you are. You'll never be free."

And I was exhausted. Barely holding on. Wondering if the enemy was right.

But then something happened. I was reading Colossians 2, and verse 15 just leaped off the page: "Having disarmed the powers and authorities, he made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them by the cross."

Disarmed. Public spectacle. Triumphed.

And I realized: I've been fighting like the outcome is in doubt. But it's not. The victory is already won. The enemy is already defeated. I'm not fighting for freedom—I'm standing in it.

The song poured out as a declaration. Not a prayer for victory, but a proclamation of victory already won.

"Devil on the run, he's a wicked beast. Tried to take me down, but he lost his feast."

The verses tell the truth about the battle: "He kicked me hard, left me buried deep." That's real. The enemy does attack. He does lie. He does try to steal, kill, and destroy.

But the chorus declares the reality: "The devil is a liar, he's done. Ain't no grace where he's from. Devil's on the run—'cause I'm saved by grace."

Notice the past tense. He's done. Not "will be done someday." Done now. Finished. Defeated.

And notice the reason: not because I'm strong, but because I'm saved by grace. The victory isn't mine—it's Christ's. And because I'm in Him, His victory is my victory.

The bridge became my battle cry: "Oh the blood! Oh the Lamb! Crushed the devil with a mighty hand."

This is where the victory was won. Not in my effort. At the cross. In Christ's finished work.

Every time I sing this song—or hear it—I'm reminded: I don't fight for victory. I fight from victory. The devil is on the run. Not because I'm powerful, but because Christ is victorious.

And in Him, I am free.

**Reflections for the Road (1-2 pages):**

**Questions for the Journey:**
- Where are you still fighting for victory instead of from victory? What battles feel desperate? Where do you feel like you're barely holding on?
- What lies has the enemy been whispering to you? Write them down. Be specific. Now counter each lie with Scripture. Find the truth that exposes the lie.
- Read Colossians 2:15 slowly. What does it mean that Jesus "disarmed" the enemy? What weapons does the enemy no longer have?
- Are you giving the devil too much credit—or not enough? What would a balanced approach look like?

**Practice: Truth Declarations**

One of the most powerful practices for spiritual warfare is declaring truth over the enemy's lies. Here's how:

**1. Identify the lie**
What is the enemy whispering to you? What accusation feels most powerful? Write it down.

**2. Find the countering truth**
Search Scripture for the truth that directly counters the lie. For example:
- Lie: "You're not really forgiven." Truth: 1 John 1:9, Colossians 1:13-14
- Lie: "God is angry with you." Truth: Romans 5:1, Romans 8:1
- Lie: "You'll never be free." Truth: John 8:36, Galatians 5:1

**3. Declare the truth out loud**
Don't just think it. Speak it. "Enemy, you say I'm not forgiven. But God's Word says that if I confess my sins, He is faithful and just to forgive me. I am forgiven—completely, fully, eternally. Your lie has no power here."

**4. Stand firm**
The lie will come back. That's what the enemy does. But every time it returns, declare the truth again.

**5. Thank God for the victory**
End by thanking God for the victory that's already been won. For the truth that sets you free. For the armor He provides. For the fact that in Christ, the devil is on the run.

---

**Closing Image:**

You're standing on the battlefield, but the battle is over. The smoke is clearing. The enemy is retreating. And you realize—you didn't win this fight. Christ did.

The victory was secured long before you arrived. The cross was the decisive blow. The resurrection was the final confirmation. The enemy was disarmed, defeated, sent running.

Your role wasn't to win. It was to stand. To hold the ground that Christ won. To resist an enemy who has no choice but to flee.

And as you look across the battlefield, you see the truth: the devil is on the run.

Not because you're powerful, but because Christ is victorious. Not because you fought hard, but because Jesus fought perfectly.

You can see him now—the enemy, scrambling, fleeing, powerless. All the lies exposed. All the accusations silenced. All the weapons stripped away.

He has nothing left. No authority. No claim. No ground to stand on.

And you? You're standing in Christ. Clothed in His righteousness. Protected by His armor. Empowered by His Spirit. Living in His victory.

The battle isn't to defeat the enemy. Christ did that at the cross.

The battle is to believe it. To stand in it. To live from it.

And when you do—when you really stand in the truth of Christ's victory—the devil has no choice but to run.

Because he's already beaten. Already disarmed. Already on the run.

And in Christ, you're on the winning side.

You whisper the truth that's become your anthem: "Jesus won. The devil lost. And I'm saved by grace."

And the enemy, hearing that truth, does the only thing he can do.

He runs.

Every single time.
