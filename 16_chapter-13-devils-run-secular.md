**An Invitation to Stand**

You've walked through twelve chapters. You've experienced rescue, rhythm, depth, redemption. You've discovered that nothing is wasted.

But now I need to ask you something crucial:

**When the accusations come at 3 AM—when they feel true—do you know where you're standing?**

You know these voices. They always show up in the dark, in the quiet, when you're too tired to fight back effectively:

*You're not really forgiven. God's still angry. You've failed too many times. You'll never be free. This sin is too big.*

And here's what makes it so hard: sometimes it feels like all the progress you've made is fragile. One accusation away from crumbling.

The enemy whispers: *See? You haven't really changed. This is who you are. This is who you'll always be.*

But here's what I've discovered, and it's the truth that changes the battle:

**This isn't a fight for victory. It's a fight from victory.**

The war is already over. The enemy has already been defeated. You're not fighting to win—you're enforcing the win that's already been won.

Colossians 2:15 says: "Having disarmed the powers and authorities, he made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them by the cross."

Disarmed. Public spectacle. Triumphed.

Past tense. Done. Finished.

This chapter is about the fundamental shift from desperate warfare to confident standing. From fighting for freedom to standing in freedom. From resisting from fear to resisting from rest.

The devil is on the run. Not because you're strong. Because Christ is victorious.

And you—standing in Christ's victory—don't have to earn freedom. You just have to stand in the freedom that's already yours.

So before you continue, pause. Consider:

*Can you say, even when the accusations feel true: "Jesus, the cross. The cross settles this. I'm not fighting for victory—I'm standing in victory. The enemy is defeated. I resist from rest, and he flees."*

That's the declaration that shifts the battle.

Because what comes next isn't about fighting harder. It's about standing firmer.

---

Let's be honest about what spiritual warfare feels like. Because if you've been in the fight, you know it's not theoretical. It's visceral.

Spiritual warfare feels like:
- **Accusations that feel true.** "You're not really forgiven. God's still angry. You've failed too many times."
- **Temptations perfectly tailored to your weaknesses.** The enemy knows where you're vulnerable.
- **Despair that whispers "give up."** What's the point? You'll never change. This is who you are.
- **Isolation.** The lie that you're alone. That no one else struggles like this. That if people knew, they'd reject you.
- **Confusion.** Feeling like you can't tell God's voice from the enemy's lies from your own thoughts.

But here's the shift: spiritual warfare from victory feels different.

When you're fighting from victory instead of for victory, the battle changes:
- **Accusations lose their power.** Not because they stop coming, but because you know they're lies. The cross settles it.
- **Temptations don't define you.** You're not your struggles. You're beloved. The temptation is an attack, not an identity.
- **Despair has no ground.** Hope is anchored in Christ's finished work, not your performance.
- **Isolation breaks.** You're part of a body. Connected. Not alone.
- **Truth becomes clear.** God's voice sounds like grace. The enemy's voice sounds like accusation. And you're learning the difference.

The battlefield is still real. The enemy still attacks. But you're not desperately fighting for freedom anymore.

You're standing in freedom. Enforcing victory. Resisting from rest.

---
## Key Themes

### 1. Fighting From Victory, Not For Victory

This is the fundamental shift. And it changes everything.

When you're fighting for victory, every battle feels desperate. Every temptation is a potential defeat. Every accusation carries the weight of judgment. You're trying to earn something, prove something, secure something through your effort.

But when you're fighting from victory, the pressure's off. You're not trying to earn freedom—you're protecting freedom that's already yours. You're not hoping to overcome—you're standing in the overcoming power of Christ.

James 4:7: "Resist the devil, and he will flee from you."

Notice what it doesn't say. It doesn't say "fight the devil until you're exhausted, and maybe he'll leave."

It says resist, and he will flee. Automatic. Guaranteed. The fleeing isn't something you make happen—it's the result of your positioning.

You resist, and he runs. Every time.

Why? Because he's already defeated. And he knows it.

You're not fighting to win. Christ won. You're enforcing that win. Standing in that victory. And when you do, the enemy has no choice but to flee.

C.S. Lewis explains the Christian's unique position:

> "The Christian is in a different position from other people who are trying to be good. They hope, by being good, to please God if there is one; or—if they think there is not—at least they hope to deserve approval from good men. But the Christian thinks any good he does comes from the Christ-life inside him."
> — C.S. Lewis, *Mere Christianity*

We're not fighting in our own strength. We're fighting from Christ's strength already at work in us.

### 2. The Lies of the Enemy vs. The Truth of Grace

The devil's primary weapon isn't force—it's deception. He can't take your salvation. He can't reverse what Christ has done. But he can lie to you about it.

And if he can get you to believe the lies, he can render you ineffective.

His strategy is always the same: make you doubt who you are in Christ.

*"You're not really forgiven."*
*"God is still angry with you."*
*"You've failed too many times."*
*"You'll never be free."*
*"This sin is too big for grace."*

Lies. All of them. But lies that feel true when you're in the swamp, when you're struggling, when you can't see clearly.

The antidote is truth. Not just knowing it intellectually, but anchoring your identity in it.

**You are forgiven—completely, fully, eternally:**

> "But if we confess our sins to him, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all wickedness."
> — 1 John 1:9 (NLT)

**God is not angry with you—His wrath was satisfied at the cross:**

> "Therefore, since we have been made right in God's sight by faith, we have peace with God because of what Jesus Christ our Lord has done for us."
> — Romans 5:1 (NLT)

**Your failures don't define you—Christ's righteousness does:**

> "For God made Christ, who never sinned, to be the offering for our sin, so that we could be made right with God through Christ."
> — 2 Corinthians 5:21 (NLT)

You are free—the chains are broken, the prison door is open (John 8:36).
No sin is too big for grace—grace is bigger than all of them combined (Romans 5:20).

When you stand in these truths, the lies lose their power. The accusations fall flat. The enemy has nothing to work with.

Because truth always defeats lies. And grace always trumps accusation.

A.W. Tozer offers a sobering reminder:

> "The devil is a better theologian than any of us and is a devil still."
> — A.W. Tozer, *The Knowledge of the Holy*

The enemy knows Scripture. He knows theology. But knowledge without submission is worthless. We don't defeat him with superior arguments—we defeat him by standing in the truth of who we are in Christ.

### 3. Colossians 2:15 – The Public Spectacle

One of the most powerful verses about spiritual warfare is Colossians 2:15:

> "And having disarmed the powers and authorities, he made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them by the cross."

This is the picture: Jesus on the cross, seemingly defeated. The enemy celebrating. But in that moment of apparent defeat, Jesus is actually stripping the enemy of every weapon, every claim, every authority.

And then—resurrection. The ultimate reversal. Death swallowed up in victory. The grave defeated. Satan disarmed. A public spectacle made of all the powers of darkness.

Disarmed. Every weapon the enemy had—sin, death, condemnation, accusation—was stripped away. He has no legitimate claim. No legal ground. No authority.

Public spectacle. The victory wasn't secret or private. It was public. Visible. Undeniable. The powers of darkness were put on display—defeated, humiliated, powerless.

Triumphing. This is the language of a victory parade. Jesus didn't just win—He celebrated. The cross wasn't Plan B. It was the plan. And it worked perfectly.

This is why the devil is on the run. He has no authority anymore. His power was stripped at the cross. His claims were nullified in the resurrection. All he has left are lies and fear—and both crumble in the presence of truth and faith.

Charles Stanley identifies the enemy's real strategy:

> "Satan's primary objective is not to lead you into a blatant sin. It's to get you to live independently of God."
> — Charles Stanley, *When the Enemy Strikes*

This is the core battle. Not spectacular moral failures, but subtle independence. Living like you don't need God. Making decisions without Him. Trusting yourself instead of Him. This is where the real warfare happens.

### 4. The Danger of Giving the Enemy Too Much Credit

There's a danger on the other side of spiritual warfare: giving the devil too much credit. Making him seem more powerful than he is. Living in constant fear of his schemes.

But the truth is, the devil is a defeated foe. He's on a leash. His time is limited. His power is broken. And he has no authority over those who are in Christ.

This doesn't mean we ignore spiritual warfare. It means we engage it from the right posture—not fear, but confidence. Not paranoia, but awareness. Not obsession with the enemy, but focus on Christ.

Some Christians see a demon behind every bush. Others deny the reality of spiritual warfare altogether. The truth is in the middle: the enemy is real, but he's already defeated.

We need to be aware, but not afraid. Alert, but not anxious. Resisting, but resting in Christ's victory.

The devil is on the run. That's the truth. But don't spend your life looking over your shoulder for him.

Keep your eyes on Jesus. Stand firm in truth. And when the enemy shows up with his lies and accusations, resist him with confidence—knowing that he has no choice but to flee.

### 5. Walking in Freedom, Not Just Fighting for It

The ultimate goal of understanding spiritual warfare isn't just to fight better—it's to walk in freedom. To live in the victory that Christ has won. To stop constantly battling and start consistently abiding.

Too many Christians spend their entire lives in spiritual warfare mode—always fighting, always resisting, always on guard. And while vigilance is important, it's not the whole picture.

The whole picture is this: Christ has set you free. The chains are broken. The prison door is open. The devil is defeated.

Your job isn't to keep fighting for that freedom. It's to walk in it. To live from it. To let it shape how you think, how you respond, how you engage with life.

Galatians 5:1: "It is for freedom that Christ has set us free. Stand firm, then, and do not let yourselves be burdened again by a yoke of slavery."

Stand firm in freedom. Don't go back to slavery. Don't pick up chains that Christ has already broken. Don't believe lies that Christ has already exposed as false.

The devil is on the run. And you're free to live like it.

## Stories of Spiritual Warfare

**Jesus' Temptation in the Wilderness (Matthew 4:1-11)**

Forty days. Forty nights. No food. No shelter. Just Jesus, alone in the wilderness—a barren landscape of stone and sand, scorching heat by day, bitter cold by night. The same wilderness where Israel wandered for forty years. The same kind of testing ground where God's people failed again and again.

Jesus is hungry. Not the kind of hunger you feel when you skip lunch. The kind that makes your stomach cramp, your head swim, your vision blur. His body is screaming for food. Every stone looks like bread. And that's exactly when the enemy shows up.

*"If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become bread."*

If. That word is a knife. The Father just spoke at Jesus' baptism: "This is my beloved Son." But now the devil plants doubt: *If* you are... *If* God really loves you, why are you starving? *If* you're really His Son, why doesn't He provide? Prove it. Use your power. Take care of yourself.

Jesus' response cuts through the fog of hunger with clarity: "It is written: 'Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God.'"

The second test shifts location—suddenly they're at the highest point of the temple in Jerusalem, hundreds of feet above the ground. People below look like ants. The drop is dizzying.

*"If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down from the temple."*

Again, *if*. But this time the devil quotes Scripture—Psalm 91, God's promise of protection. See? God will catch you. He has to. It's promised. Test it. Prove it. Force God's hand.

Jesus doesn't flinch: "It is also written: 'Do not put the Lord your God to the test.'"

The third temptation is the most brazen. The devil shows Jesus all the kingdoms of the world in an instant—their wealth, their power, their glory. Everything Jesus came to redeem, offered as a shortcut.

*"All this I will give you if you will bow down and worship me."*

No more *if*. Now it's a straight-up offer: Skip the cross. Avoid the suffering. Take the kingdom now. Just bow.

Jesus' final response is sharp, decisive: "Away from me, Satan! For it is written: 'Worship the Lord your God, and serve him only.'"

And the devil left. Fled. Ran.

This is the pattern for every believer. The enemy will attack your identity in Christ. He'll offer shortcuts. He'll tempt you to doubt God's promises.

Your response? Stand on truth. Speak Scripture. Resist with confidence.

And he will flee. Just like he fled from Jesus.

**Peter Sinking (Matthew 14:22-33)**

The storm hits in the middle of the night. Wind howling. Waves crashing over the bow. The disciples are straining at the oars, trying to keep the boat from capsizing. They're experienced fishermen—they've been through storms before. But this one is different. Relentless. Exhausting. And Jesus isn't with them.

Then, in the pre-dawn darkness, they see something impossible: a figure walking on the water. Their first reaction isn't faith—it's terror. "It's a ghost!" But then they hear His voice cutting through the wind: "Take courage! It is I. Don't be afraid."

Peter, impulsive as always, shouts back: "Lord, if it's you, tell me to come to you on the water."

"Come."

One word. One invitation. And Peter—reckless, passionate Peter—climbs over the side of the boat. His foot touches the surface. And it holds. He takes another step. Still holding. He's walking on water. Actually walking on water.

For a few glorious moments, Peter is doing the impossible. Eyes locked on Jesus. Faith overriding physics.

Then he notices the wind. Feels the spray of the waves hitting his legs. Hears the roar of the storm around him. His brain catches up with what he's doing—*I'm standing on water, this is insane, I'm going to drown*—and the moment he shifts his focus from Jesus to the circumstances, he starts to sink.

Not slowly. Fast. Water up to his knees, his waist, his chest. Panic floods in.

And he cries out: "Lord, save me!"

Three words. Not a theological treatise. Not a confession of unworthiness. Not an apology for his lack of faith. Just a desperate, drowning cry.

And immediately—not after Peter proved himself, not after Peter had a better attitude, not after Peter pulled himself together and deserved it—immediately, Jesus reached out His hand and caught him.

That's the pattern. Not "get yourself together and then call on Jesus." But "call on Jesus from the middle of your sinking."

The enemy wants you to think you have to fix yourself before God will help you. But Jesus reaches out immediately when you cry out.

> "We are not necessarily doubting that God will do the best for us; we are wondering how painful the best will turn out to be."
> — C.S. Lewis, *Letters to Malcolm*

**The Fall of Satan (Revelation 12:7-12)**

Picture the scene: war breaks out in heaven. Not a skirmish. Not a disagreement. War. Michael and his angels arrayed against the dragon and his forces. The ancient serpent, the one who deceived Eve in the garden, the accuser who has stood before God's throne day and night bringing charges against His people—he thought he could win.

But he couldn't. "He was not strong enough."

> "Then war broke out in heaven... But he was not strong enough, and they lost their place in heaven. The great dragon was hurled down—that ancient serpent called the devil, or Satan... The accuser of our brothers and sisters, who accuses them before our God day and night, has been hurled down."
>
> — Revelation 12:7-10

Not escorted out. Not gently removed. Hurled. Thrown down like a defeated enemy. The one who claimed to be like God, the one who promised Eve she could be like God, the one who has been accusing God's children for millennia—cast out. Expelled. Defeated.

And the response of heaven? Not relief. Not cautious celebration. A victory shout: "Now have come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Messiah!"

The accuser is cast down. His accusations no longer stand. His authority is revoked. His place in heaven is gone. The victory is complete, cosmic, irreversible.

And the call to believers?

> "They triumphed over him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony; they did not love their lives so much as to shrink from death."
>
> — Revelation 12:11

You overcome by the blood of the Lamb (Christ's finished work) and the word of your testimony (standing in truth).

Christ's victory + your faith = the devil on the run.

## The Core Scripture Truth

**Colossians 2:13-15** - "And having disarmed the powers and authorities, he made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them by the cross."

The cross is the turning point of all spiritual warfare. What looked like defeat was actually the decisive victory.

Jesus didn't just survive the enemy's attack—He dismantled it.

**Disarmed.** Every weapon the enemy had—sin, death, condemnation, accusation—was stripped away. He has no legitimate claim. No legal ground. No authority.

**Public spectacle.** The victory wasn't secret or private. It was public. Visible. Undeniable. The powers of darkness were put on display—defeated, humiliated, powerless.

**Triumphing.** This is the language of a victory parade. Jesus didn't just win—He celebrated. The cross wasn't Plan B. It was the plan. And it worked perfectly.

This is the theological foundation for "the devil is on the run." Not wishful thinking. Not positive confession. Not spiritual bravado.

Reality. Accomplished fact. The cross changed everything.

Ephesians 6:10-11: "Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power. Put on the full armor of God, so that you can take your stand against the devil's schemes."

Notice: you're strong in the Lord, not in yourself. The armor is God's armor, not your own. And the call is to stand, not to fight for ground you don't have.

You're holding ground that's already been won. Standing in victory that's already been secured. Resisting an enemy who's already been defeated.

This is spiritual warfare from rest. From confidence. From the unforced rhythms of grace.

The devil is on the run. Not because you're strong, but because Christ is victorious.

And in Him, you share that victory.

---
## The Wayfarer Moment

The shift from fighting for victory to fighting from victory changed everything for me.

For years, I felt like I was barely holding on. Every temptation was a potential defeat. Every accusation felt true. Every battle left me exhausted, wondering if I'd survive the next one.

I was fighting for victory—trying to earn it, prove it, secure it through my effort and willpower.

But I kept losing. Or at best, barely winning. And the exhaustion was crushing.

Then I encountered Colossians 2:15. "Having disarmed the powers and authorities, he made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them by the cross."

Wait. The enemy is already disarmed? Already defeated? Already on the run?

It didn't feel that way. It felt like he was winning. Gaining ground. Stealing my peace, my joy, my confidence.

But the truth wasn't about how it felt. It was about what Christ accomplished.

And slowly—so slowly—I began to shift. From fighting for victory to fighting from victory. From desperation to confidence. From fear to faith.

I started speaking truth to the lies. Not hoping the truth would work, but knowing it would.

*"You say I'm not forgiven. But Scripture says I am—completely, fully, eternally."*
*"You say God is angry with me. But Scripture says His wrath was satisfied at the cross."*
*"You say I'll never be free. But Scripture says whom the Son sets free is free indeed."*

And every time I stood on truth, the lies lost their power. The accusations fell flat. The enemy fled.

Not because I was strong. But because I was standing on ground he couldn't touch.

I'm still learning this. Still growing in it. There are days when the lies feel louder than the truth. Days when I forget that the victory is already won.

But more and more, I'm living from victory instead of for it. Resisting from rest instead of from fear. Standing in confidence because Christ has already triumphed.

The devil is on the run. And I'm learning to live in the freedom of that reality.

## Song Integration

The attack came when I thought I was finally safe. I'd been out of the swamp, washed at the water's edge, learning the rhythms, sending roots deep. Then the accusations started—relentless, day and night. "You're not really changed. You'll always be that person. You'll never be free." I was exhausted, barely holding on, wondering if the enemy was right. I was fighting for my freedom, fighting to prove I was really changed, fighting to hold onto ground I'd gained. And I was losing.

Then something happened. I was reading Colossians 2, barely able to focus, when verse 15 leaped off the page: *"Having disarmed the powers and authorities, he made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them by the cross."* Three words stopped me: **Disarmed. Public spectacle. Triumphed.** In that moment, I realized what I'd been doing wrong.

I'd been fighting **for** victory—like the outcome was in doubt, like I had to win through my strength, my determination, my spiritual disciplines. But that's not how it works. The victory is already won. The enemy is already defeated. Jesus didn't just wound him—He disarmed him, stripped him of his weapons, made a public spectacle of his defeat, triumphed over every power of darkness. **Past tense. Done. Finished.**

I don't fight **for** victory. I fight **from** victory. The devil isn't a threat I have to overcome. He's a defeated foe I resist from a position of victory. This shift changed everything. When you're fighting **for** victory, you fight from fear, from desperation, from weakness. But when you're fighting **from** victory, you fight from confidence, from rest, from strength—not your own, but Christ's.

This is a declaration, a proclamation, a battle cry. When you're in spiritual warfare, you don't whisper or hedge. You declare truth—loudly, boldly, with authority. The song does exactly this. It's aggressive, confrontational, declarative. Each line hits like a punch. Because that's what truth does to lies—it demolishes them.

The chorus declares: *"The devil is a liar, he's done. Ain't no grace where he's from. Devil's on the run—'cause I'm saved by grace."* Three truths: (1) The devil is a liar—everything he says is deception, every accusation false. (2) He's done—past tense, finished, defeated. Not "will be done someday." Done now. (3) Devil's on the run—he's the one fleeing, not me. Because I'm saved by grace. Notice: the reason for his defeat isn't my strength. It's grace. Always grace.

The bridge goes back to the source: *"Oh the blood! Oh the Lamb! Crushed the devil with a mighty hand."* The victory wasn't won in my bedroom during a spiritual battle. It was won at Calvary two thousand years ago when Jesus shed His blood and crushed the serpent's head. Everything I'm declaring in this song is grounded in that finished work—not in my effort or discipline, but in His blood, His sacrifice, His triumph.

Since writing this song, my approach to spiritual warfare has completely changed. I used to enter battles with anxiety. Now I enter with declarations: "Devil, you're already defeated. Christ disarmed you. You have no power here." I used to fight from fear. Now I fight from rest. Because the outcome isn't in doubt. I used to beg God for victory. Now I thank Him for victory already won and resist the enemy from that position of confidence.

You don't fight to become victorious. You fight because you already are. You don't resist the devil hoping he'll flee. You resist him knowing he must flee because he's already defeated. You don't beg for freedom. You stand in the freedom Christ already won. The devil is on the run. Not someday. Right now.

## Lyrics: Devil's On The Run

**[Verse 1]**
Devil on the run
He's a wicked beast
Tried to take me down
But he lost his feast
He kicked me hard
Left me buried deep
But I rose in grace
While he lost his keep

**[Verse 2]**
In my darkest night
I forgot the gift I had
He pulled me low
Told me lies and made me mad
But even in the pit
Jesus called my name
Now I walk in light
I'm not the same

**[Pre-Chorus]**
Don't be fooled
By the snake in the weeds
He don't care
'Bout your hope or your needs
He can't give life
Only takes what you earn
He'll torch it all
Just to watch it burn

**[Chorus]**
Now I rise, now I run
By the power of the Son
But the Devil is a liar
He's Done!!
Ain't no grace where he's from
Tried to steal, tried to kill
But my soul he couldn't take
Devil's on the run
'Cause I'm saved by grace

**[Verse 3]**
Chains are gone
Yeah, the stone rolled back
He lost the war
On a bloodstained track
Truth is fire
And the lie won't stand
I'm a child of God
With a sword in my hand

**[Chorus – repeat]**
Now I rise, now I run
By the power of the Son
But the Devil is a liar
He's Done!!
Ain't no grace where he's from
Tried to steal, tried to kill
But my soul he couldn't take
Devil's on the run
'Cause I'm saved by grace

**[Bridge – Breakdown / Call & Response]**
Oh the blood!
Oh the Lamb!
Crushed the devil
With a mighty hand
Ain't no grave!
Gonna hold me down!
I've been bought
And I wear the crown
You can growl
You can scream
But you can't run
From the King
Devil's on the run—
He lost everything

**[Final Chorus – Tag out strong]**
Now I rise, now I run
By the power of the Son
But the Devil is a liar
He's Done!!
Ain't no grace where he's from
Tried to steal, tried to kill
But my soul he couldn't take
Devil's on the run
Yeah, the devil's on the run
Jesus won — and I'm saved by grace

## Key Takeaways

- **Fight from victory, not for victory.** The battle was won at the cross. You're not fighting to defeat the enemy—you're enforcing Christ's already-accomplished victory by standing firm in truth.
- **The devil is already defeated.** Colossians 2:15 declares that Jesus disarmed the powers and authorities and made a public spectacle of them. Don't give a defeated enemy more credit than he deserves.
- **Lies lose power when exposed to truth.** The enemy's primary weapon is deception. When you identify the lie and speak God's truth over it, the stronghold crumbles. Light always dispels darkness.
- **Walk in the freedom Christ secured.** You're not in bondage anymore—you're free. Live like it. Resist the devil from a place of rest, not fear, knowing he must flee when you stand firm.

## Reflections for the Road

**Questions for the Journey:**
- Where are you still fighting for victory instead of from victory? What battles feel desperate? Where do you feel like you're barely holding on?
- What lies has the enemy been whispering to you? Write them down. Be specific. Now counter each lie with Scripture. Find the truth that exposes the lie.
- Read Colossians 2:15 slowly. What does it mean that Jesus "disarmed" the enemy? What weapons does the enemy no longer have?
- Are you giving the devil too much credit—or not enough? What would a balanced approach look like?

---

## Practice: Truth Declarations

One of the most powerful practices for spiritual warfare is declaring truth over the enemy's lies. Here's how:

### 1. Identify the lie
What is the enemy whispering to you? What accusation feels most powerful? Write it down.

### 2. Find the countering truth
Search Scripture for the truth that directly counters the lie. For example:
- Lie: "You're not really forgiven." Truth: 1 John 1:9, Colossians 1:13-14
- Lie: "God is angry with you." Truth: Romans 5:1, Romans 8:1
- Lie: "You'll never be free." Truth: John 8:36, Galatians 5:1

### 3. Declare the truth out loud
Don't just think it. Speak it. "Enemy, you say I'm not forgiven. But God's Word says that if I confess my sins, He is faithful and just to forgive me. I am forgiven—completely, fully, eternally. Your lie has no power here."

### 4. Stand firm
The lie will come back. That's what the enemy does. But every time it returns, declare the truth again.

### 5. Thank God for the victory
End by thanking God for the victory that's already been won. For the truth that sets you free. For the armor He provides. For the fact that in Christ, the devil is on the run.

## Closing Image

You're standing on the battlefield, but the battle is over. The smoke is clearing. The enemy is retreating. And you realize—you didn't win this fight. Christ did.

The victory was secured long before you arrived. The cross was the decisive blow. The resurrection was the final confirmation. The enemy was disarmed, defeated, sent running.

Your role wasn't to win. It was to stand. To hold the ground that Christ won. To resist an enemy who has no choice but to flee.

And as you look across the battlefield, you see the truth: the devil is on the run.

Not because you're powerful, but because Christ is victorious. Not because you fought hard, but because Jesus fought perfectly.

You can see him now—the enemy, scrambling, fleeing, powerless. All the lies exposed. All the accusations silenced. All the weapons stripped away.

He has nothing left. No authority. No claim. No ground to stand on.

And you? You're standing in Christ. Clothed in His righteousness. Protected by His armor. Empowered by His Spirit. Living in His victory.

The battle isn't to defeat the enemy. Christ did that at the cross.

The battle is to believe it. To stand in it. To live from it.

And when you do—when you really stand in the truth of Christ's victory—the devil has no choice but to run.

Because he's already beaten. Already disarmed. Already on the run.

And in Christ, you're on the winning side.

You whisper the truth that's become your anthem: "Jesus won. The devil lost. And I'm saved by grace."

And the enemy, hearing that truth, does the only thing he can do.

He runs.

Every single time.
