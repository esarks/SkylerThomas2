**Before we go further, let me ask you something.**

Have you ever stood at a threshold between your old life and something new? Not knowing if you're ready. Not sure you're worthy. Covered in the evidence of where you've been, wondering if you're clean enough to step forward?

That's where this chapter lives. At the water's edge.

And here's what I want you to know: You don't have to clean up first. The water is what cleans you.

I know that might sound strange. Or too good to be true. Or like spiritual talk that doesn't apply to real life.

But stay with me. Because this chapter is about the moment when everything you've been carrying—the shame, the failure, the mud from the swamp—meets something that can actually wash it away.

Can you be open to that possibility? Even if you don't fully believe it yet?

---

There's a moment between leaving and arriving that feels impossible.

You've left the swamp—made the decision, taken the first steps, walked away from the place that was killing you. But you haven't arrived anywhere yet. You're in the liminal space. The threshold. The water's edge.

Behind you: everything you've known. The familiar toxicity. The adaptive survival patterns. The identity you built in the muck.

Ahead of you: the unknown. Clean water that both attracts and terrifies you. An invitation you're not sure you're qualified to accept.

And here's what makes this moment so hard: the swamp is still on you. You can smell it on your clothes. Feel the dried mud cracking on your skin. Taste the bitterness in your mouth. You've left, but you're not yet clean. You've chosen freedom, but you're not yet free.

This is the water's edge—where decision meets transformation. Where leaving meets arriving. Where the old is passing away but the new hasn't yet fully come.

And the question that haunts you: Can I really step into that clean water looking like this?

Part of you wants to clean up first. Get yourself together. Become worthy of the gift before you receive it.

But there's no pre-water ritual. No "get yourself ready first" station.

Just the water. And you. And the invitation.

The writing that follows came from my time at this threshold. When I'd made the decision to leave but couldn't yet see how transformation would happen. When I stood at the edge of grace, covered in swamp, and had to learn the hardest lesson:

You don't clean up to receive grace. Grace is what cleans you up.

*Take a breath.*

You kneel at the water's edge, hands trembling. The bank is soft under your knees. You lean forward, cupping your hands together, and dip them into the water.

It's shockingly cold. So cold it almost hurts. But also... alive. You can feel the current trying to pull your hands downstream. You can feel the movement, the energy, the power.

You lift your cupped hands to your lips and drink.

The water is cold and sweet and everything you didn't know you needed. It tastes like snow-melt and stone and something you can only call purity. It washes away the bitter taste of the swamp, the metallic tang of fear, the sour residue of shame.

You drink again. And again. Greedy for it now. Desperate for it.

And as you drink, something inside you whispers: This is what I've been thirsting for. Not just water. Living water. The kind that reaches all the way down into the dried-up, hollowed-out places and says, "I can make this live again."

You look at the river. Then at yourself. Then back at the river.

The invitation is clear: Come in. Let yourself be washed. Let the water do what you cannot do for yourself.

But can you? Can you really step into that clean water covered in all this filth? Can you trust that the water is strong enough to handle your mess?

The sun climbs higher. The mist begins to thin. And you're still kneeling at the water's edge, caught between the swamp you've left and the cleansing you need, wondering if grace is really as scandalous as they say—scandalous enough to wash even you.

## Key Themes

**1. Water as Metaphor for Grace, Healing, and Forgiveness**

Water runs through human wisdom and spiritual literature like a river through a landscape—sometimes quiet and life-giving, sometimes wild and dangerous, always significant. From ancient creation stories to modern poetry, water marks the places where transformation happens.

In the beginning, divine presence hovered over the waters—over chaos, over the formless void—and spoke order into being. Water was there at creation, and it's been a sign of creative, transformative power ever since.

Throughout ancient texts, water appears at pivotal moments: It destroys and preserves in the flood. It parts to deliver in the Exodus. It heals disease in the Jordan. It flows from rock in the wilderness. It pours from the temple in prophetic visions, bringing life wherever it flows.

**Water is life.** Without it, everything dies—plants, animals, humans. Our bodies are mostly water. We can survive weeks without food, but only days without water. Essential. Irreplaceable. Fundamental.

**Water is cleansing.** It washes. When you're dirty, you don't wipe yourself with a dry cloth and call it clean. You need water. Water lifts away grime, stain, contamination. Does what nothing else can.

**Water is healing.** It soothes. Cools fever. Softens wounds. Ancient peoples built civilizations around water sources not just for survival but for health. Healing springs and sacred waters dot human history because we've always known: water heals.

**Water is transformation.** In baptism and other spiritual rituals across cultures, we go under—a death, a burial of the old self. We come up—a resurrection, a new creation. Water doesn't just clean the outside; it marks an internal shift. "I am not who I was. I have passed through water and emerged different."

**Water is abundance.** When healing provides water, it doesn't give a trickle. It gives rivers. Streams that never run dry. Wells that never empty. Water that flows "to eternal life."

Grace is all of this.

Life-giving—without it, we're spiritually dead. Cleansing—it washes away what we cannot scrub off ourselves. Healing—it touches our deepest wounds and makes us whole. Transformative—it doesn't just improve us; it recreates us. Abundant—there's always more, always enough, always overflowing.

Philip Yancey captures this beautifully:

> "Grace means there is nothing we can do to make God love us more—and nothing we can do to make God love us less. Grace means that God already loves us as much as an infinite God can possibly love."
>
> — Philip Yancey, *What's So Amazing About Grace?*

The water's edge is where we come face to face with grace. Not as concept. Not as theology. But as reality.

As tangible as the river in front of us. As real as water on skin.

**2. The Edge as the Place of Encounter**

Edges matter in sacred stories. Thresholds. Boundaries. The places where one thing ends and another begins. The water's edge is one of those sacred thresholds—a place where ordinary and extraordinary seem to touch, where people meet what's Real.

**Want to hear a story about this?**

There's an ancient account in the Gospel of John, chapter 4, about a woman who came to a well at noon—the hottest time of day, when nobody else would be there. She was hiding from judgment, carrying shame from five failed marriages.

And she met someone there. Someone who offered her something she didn't expect:

> "When a Samaritan woman came to draw water, Jesus said to her, 'Will you give me a drink?' (His disciples had gone into the town to buy food.) The Samaritan woman said to him, 'You are a Jew and I am a Samaritan woman. How can you ask me for a drink?' (For Jews do not associate with Samaritans.)"
>
> — John 4:7-9 (The Message)

This encounter happens at high noon—the harshest part of the day. But she comes then precisely because she's avoiding everyone else. Five marriages have failed. She's now living with a man who isn't her husband. The whole town knows. They whisper. Judge.

So she comes when she won't have to face them.

And there, at the well—at the water's edge—she finds Jesus.

He does something scandalous right from the start: He speaks to her. Jews don't speak to Samaritans. Men don't speak to women they're not related to. Rabbis don't speak to women of questionable reputation.

But Jesus does all three. Shatters every social boundary with a simple request: "Will you give me a drink?"

She's shocked. "You are a Jew and I am a Samaritan woman. How can you ask me for a drink?"

But Jesus doesn't engage the cultural debate. He goes deeper: "If you knew the gift of God and who it is that asks you for a drink, you would have asked him and he would have given you living water."

She looks at the well. Deep, stone-lined, requiring a rope and bucket to access. She looks at Jesus. He has no bucket, no rope, nothing to draw with. "Sir, you have nothing to draw with and the well is deep. Where can you get this living water?"

She's thinking practically. Literally. She needs actual water for actual thirst. But Jesus is offering something deeper:

> "Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again, but whoever drinks the water I give them will never thirst. Indeed, the water I give them will become in them a spring of water welling up to eternal life."
>
> — John 4:13-14 (The Message)

The conversation shifts. Jesus asks about her husband. She tries to deflect: "I have no husband."

Jesus responds with devastating gentleness: "You are right when you say you have no husband. The fact is, you have had five husbands, and the man you now have is not your husband. What you have just said is quite true."

He sees her. Completely. Knows her history. Knows her shame. Knows her secrets.

And He doesn't condemn. Doesn't lecture. Doesn't reject.

He just... sees her.

*Pause and consider: What would it feel like to be truly seen—completely known—and not condemned?*

And being truly seen—without condemnation, without rejection, with nothing but love—changes everything.

She starts asking theological questions, trying to understand this man who knows her completely and still speaks to her with dignity. Jesus reveals Himself: "I, the one speaking to you—I am he." The Messiah. The one she and her people have been waiting for.

And she believes. Right there at the well. At the water's edge.

She leaves her water jar—the very thing she came for—and runs back to town. The town she'd been avoiding. And she tells everyone: "Come, see a man who told me everything I ever did. Could this be the Messiah?"

The woman who came in shame leaves as an evangelist. The woman who came alone in the heat of the day returns to bring the whole town to meet Jesus. The woman who came thirsty for water leaves having drunk from the source of living water.

That's what happens at the water's edge.

---

Or consider another story from the book of Joshua. Ancient Israel stood on the edge of the promised land after wandering forty years. Between them and the promise: the Jordan River. And it's not just flowing—it's flooding:

> "Now the Jordan is at flood stage all during harvest. Yet as soon as the priests who carried the ark reached the Jordan and their feet touched the water's edge, the water from upstream stopped flowing. It piled up in a heap a great distance away... So the people crossed over."
>
> — Joshua 3:15-16 (The Message)

God gives Joshua strange instructions: Have the priests carrying the ark of the covenant step into the water. Not after it parts. Before. While it's still flooding.

They have to get their feet wet before the miracle happens.

Imagine being one of those priests. Carrying the most sacred object—the symbol of divine presence—toward a flooding river. Every instinct screams: Wait for the water to stop! Don't risk it! Don't step in until it's safe!

But that's not how trust works. Trust doesn't wait for risk to disappear. Trust steps in while the risk is real.

And they do it. The moment their feet touch the water's edge, the water from upstream stops flowing.

The water's edge is where obedience meets miracle. Where faith becomes sight. Where stepping forward in trust releases transformative power.

The edge is the threshold. You can stand on the shore and talk about water all day. You can study it, analyze it, understand its chemical composition. But until you step in—until your feet touch the water's edge—you don't experience it.

Eugene Peterson writes:

> "The Christian life is not a quiet escape to a garden where we can walk and talk uninterruptedly with our Lord; nor is it a fantasy trip to a heavenly city where we can compare our blue ribbons and gold medals with other Christians... It is the active and loving obedience of faith, lived in the rough and tumble of this world, where God's grace intersects with human need."
>
> — Eugene Peterson, *A Long Obedience in the Same Direction*

The water's edge is where that intersection happens. Where grace meets our desperate need. Where theology becomes experience.

**3. The Transition from Running From to Running Toward**

There's a psychological and spiritual shift that happens at the water's edge. A reversal. A turning.

Before, we run from what's Real. We hide like the first humans in the garden: "I heard you, and I was afraid because I was naked; so I hid."

We flee like Jonah, running to get as far from truth's call as possible, ending up in the belly of a fish before we finally surrender.

We avoid by staying so busy with activity that we never have to face the intimacy that Reality actually wants with us.

Why do we run? Because we're afraid. Afraid Reality will see the real us and be disappointed. Afraid it will demand things we're not willing to give. Afraid we'll be rejected if we don't perform well enough. Afraid that if we get too close, we'll discover that love has conditions after all.

So we run. Or we hide. Or we stay busy. Anything to keep truth at arm's length.

But the swamp changes things. In the swamp, hiding doesn't work anymore. Performance fails. Busyness exhausts us. And we discover that we're not running from judgment—we're running from love.

Because judgment we could handle. We've been handling judgment our whole lives. Self-judgment, others' judgment, internalized shame—we know what to do with that. We perform, we prove ourselves, we try harder.

But love? Unconditional, unearned, relentless love? That's terrifying.

Because if we're loved as we are, then we have to stop performing. Stop earning. Stop hiding. And we don't know who we'd be without all that.

At the water's edge, something shifts. We stop running from and start stumbling toward.

We start seeking like the ancient poet: "As the deer pants for streams of water, so my soul pants for you."

We start thirsting like the crowds who heard Jesus cry out: "Let anyone who is thirsty come to me and drink."

We start reaching like the woman with the issue of blood, desperate enough to push through the crowd and touch the hem of Jesus' garment because we finally realize: Our greatest danger isn't being seen in our need. Our greatest danger is dying of thirst while standing next to the fountain.

A.W. Tozer understood this desperate thirst:

> "God is looking for people through whom He can do the impossible—what a pity that we plan only the things that we can do by ourselves."
>
> — A.W. Tozer, *The Pursuit of God*

We come to the water when we finally admit we can't save ourselves. When we stop planning what we can do and start receiving what only God can do.

For years, I ran. I was in ministry, leading worship, teaching, doing all the "God things"—and running. Because I was terrified He'd get too close and see the real me. The mess. The doubt. The darkness. The anger. The parts that didn't fit the image.

The swamp was awful, but at least I could hide there. At least the mud covered me. At least I could blend into the murk and no one—not even God—could see clearly.

But at the water's edge, I couldn't hide anymore. I was exposed. Vulnerable. Raw.

And I realized: I wasn't running from judgment. I was running from love.

The water's edge is where I stopped running from God and started stumbling toward Him. Where I discovered that the most honest prayer I could pray wasn't "Make me good enough." It was "See me as I am—and please don't turn away."

And He didn't. He doesn't. He never does.

**4. Baptism: Death to Old, Birth to New**

Baptism is the ritual of the water's edge. It's the physical enactment of what happens spiritually when we come to what's Real. Going under—death, burial of the old self. Coming up—resurrection, new life, new creation.

Paul makes this explicit in Romans 6:

> "We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life. For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we will certainly also be united with him in a resurrection like his."
>
> — Romans 6:4-5 (The Message)

Baptism is not a work that saves you. Salvation is by grace through faith, not by any ritual or religious act we perform. Baptism is not magic—it doesn't automatically change you the moment you go under the water. And baptism is not a performance, a way to prove to others that you're good enough or spiritual enough.

Baptism is a sign. A statement. A declaration.

**It's a death**—to the old self, the false self, the self that was separated from truth and trying to save itself through performance and pretense.

**It's a statement of faith**—"I believe transformation is real, and I'm united with that reality in death and resurrection."

**It's a public declaration**—"I'm not hiding anymore. I'm claiming my identity as someone loved, someone being made new."

**It's a new identity**—"I am being transformed; wholeness is in me. My old identity—defined by shame, failure, and performance—is gone. My new identity is beloved."

Even if you were baptized years ago—maybe as a child, maybe as a new believer, maybe in a season when you only partly understood what it meant—this chapter invites you to remember. To re-enter that moment. To live into what it means.

You died. You were buried. You were raised. You're alive in something new.

That's not just past tense. That's present reality.

Every morning, you can wake up and remember: The old me is dead. The new me is alive. I don't have to earn my identity. I don't have to prove my worth. I don't have to perform for love. I'm already loved. Already accepted. Already made new.

Dietrich Bonhoeffer speaks to this profound reality:

> "Baptism is not an offer which man makes to God, but an offer which God makes to man. At the same time, it is not merely God's offer: it is also God's commandment... Baptism is the gift of Christ himself to his own."
>
> — Dietrich Bonhoeffer, *The Cost of Discipleship*

Baptism isn't only about our pledge to God—it's also about God's pledge to us. The water's edge is where we receive what Love offers, not where we prove we're worthy to receive it. What we give is ourselves, just as we are.

**5. The Vulnerability of Letting Yourself Be Washed**

There's something deeply vulnerable about being washed. To be washed, you have to be touched. You have to let someone see the dirt. You have to stop hiding.

This is the tender, terrifying heart of the chapter.

Think about Jesus washing the disciples' feet in John 13:

> "He came to Simon Peter, who said to him, 'Lord, are you going to wash my feet?' Jesus replied, 'You do not realize now what I am doing, but later you will understand.' 'No,' said Peter, 'you shall never wash my feet.' Jesus answered, 'Unless I wash you, you have no part with me.'"
>
> — John 13:6-8 (The Message)

It's the night before His crucifixion. Jesus knows what's coming. And He takes off His outer garment, wraps a towel around His waist, pours water into a basin, and begins washing their feet.

Peter's reaction is classic: "No, you shall never wash my feet!"

Why? Because it's humiliating. The Master shouldn't serve the servant. The clean shouldn't touch the dirty. This is backwards. Wrong. Uncomfortable.

But Jesus says something profound: "Unless I wash you, you have no part with me."

Let that sink in. Unless I wash you. Not "unless you wash yourself." Not "unless you clean up first." Unless I wash you.

What's He saying? You're already loved. Already accepted. Already Mine. You just need to let Me serve you. Let Me wash the parts of you that have gotten dirty walking through this world. Let Me touch the places you think are too shameful, too broken, too contaminated.

For us, the vulnerability is this: Admitting we need washing. Admitting we can't clean ourselves up. Admitting we're dirty and letting Love touch the dirt.

That's terrifying. Because what if it recoils? What if even grace has limits? What if I'm too much even for living water?

But the wayfarer at the water's edge discovers: Grace has no limits. Grace washes what shame says is unwashable. Grace touches what fear says is untouchable.

Timothy Keller illuminates this scandalous grace:

> "The gospel is this: We are more sinful and flawed in ourselves than we ever dared believe, yet at the very same time we are more loved and accepted in Jesus Christ than we ever dared hope."
>
> — Timothy Keller, *The Meaning of Marriage*

This is the water's edge truth: You're worse than you thought—and more loved than you imagined. Both at the same time.

At the water's edge, I was trying hard to practice vulnerability and connection. I was meeting with friends, making progress on creative projects, engaging in introspection and prayer. Outwardly, momentum was building.

But I was also exhausted. Disconnected at times. Empty in ways I couldn't quite articulate.

The water's edge isn't instant healing. It's the beginning of healing. You can be making real progress and still feel the weight of the journey. That's not failure—that's honesty.

Ruth Haley Barton writes about this tender in-between place:

> "Transformation is not about trying harder or doing more. It is about entering more deeply into the mystery of our own belovedness... and trusting the process that is beyond our control."
>
> — Ruth Haley Barton, *Sacred Rhythms*

At the water's edge, we learn to trust the process even when we can't control the outcome. We step in, covered in mud, and trust the water to do what only water can do.

You can be stepping toward the water and still be covered in swamp mud. That's not hypocrisy—that's the reality of transformation. It doesn't happen all at once. It happens in stages, in steps, in moments of surrender and trust.

## The Core Scripture Truth

Here's where I need to be straight with you about something from scripture.

There's an invitation—words spoken by Jesus himself—that speaks directly to this moment:

> "Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light."
>
> — Matthew 11:28-30 (The Message)

*Come, all you who are weary and burdened.*

Burned out. Swamp-stuck. Performance-exhausted.

That's you. That's me.

And the voice says: Come.

Not "clean up first." Not "try harder." Just come. As you are. Muck and all.

And I will give you rest.

And there's another invitation, spoken at a festival in Jerusalem:

> "On the last and greatest day of the festival, Jesus stood and said in a loud voice, 'Let anyone who is thirsty come to me and drink. Whoever believes in me, as Scripture has said, rivers of living water will flow from within them.'"
>
> — John 7:37-38 (The Message)

Let this sink in slowly.

**"Let anyone who is thirsty come":**

Not anyone who's good enough. Not anyone who's cleaned up. Not anyone who's figured it out. Not anyone who's earned it.

Anyone who's thirsty.

Are you thirsty? Parched. Dry. Desperate for something that will actually satisfy. Then you qualify. That's the only requirement: thirst.

**"Come to me and drink":**

Not come to religion. Not come to rules. Not come to a system or a program or a set of principles.

Come to Me. Jesus. Person. Presence. The source of living water.

And drink. Receive. Take in. Stop trying to earn it and just receive it. Open your mouth and let the water in. Let it quench the thirst you've been carrying for years.

**"Rivers of living water will flow from within them":**

Not a trickle. Rivers. Plural. Not scarcity—abundance. Not barely enough—overflowing.

Not stagnant water. Living water. Water that moves, that flows, that brings life wherever it goes.

Not external only. From within—internal transformation that flows outward. You don't just get washed on the outside. You become a source of living water yourself. The Spirit dwells in you, and what flows from you is the same life-giving, cleansing, healing water that you received.

John adds commentary: "By this he meant the Spirit, whom those who believed in him were later to receive."

Living water equals the Holy Spirit. God's very presence dwelling in you. Not visiting occasionally. Not hovering nearby. Dwelling. Making His home. Taking up residence in the deepest parts of you.

This is the promise at the water's edge: You will be filled. Not just cleaned. Filled. With God's Spirit. God's life. God's love. And it will flow from you like a river—life-giving, cleansing, healing—to everyone around you.

The invitation stands: "Let anyone who is thirsty come to me and drink."

Come to the water's edge. Come as you are—muddy, ashamed, broken, desperate. Come thirsty. And drink.

## The Wayfarer Moment

**You don't clean yourself up before you come to the water. You come to the water to be cleaned.**

This is the scandal of grace. The offense of it. The relief of it.

You don't have to fix yourself first. You can't. That's the whole point.

You come as you are. Mud-covered. Shame-soaked. Exhausted from trying and failing. Broken from years of pretending. Thirsty beyond words.

And grace washes you.

Not because you earned it. Not because you finally got good enough. Not because you proved yourself worthy.

Because grace is grace. Unearned. Undeserved. Freely given.

I'm not into sports. I couldn't tell you any sports news from last week. And yet, I'll never forget April 3rd, 2014.

I flew to Oklahoma City to visit my best friend. Stopped by his office. Then headed downtown to watch Kevin Durant and the Oklahoma City Thunder dominate the San Antonio Spurs. For those few hours, I could forget about my miserable lot in life. Forget how I'd destroyed my family and marriage.

I was escaping. Running. Fleeing.

But you know what they say: The only problem with running is that everywhere you go, you're there.

The next morning I woke up, and I was there. Still carrying the mess I'd created back home. I decided it was time to do some work on my life. Which meant—for me—going somewhere to think, to pray, to meditate.

The conditions in Oklahoma at the time were very dry. I found myself at Lake Hefner in North Oklahoma City, sitting at the end of a boat ramp. It seemed like a good place to connect with God and figure out what brought me to this point.

Figuratively, it looked like my life: the end of the road.

What would I do?

I walked to the end of the boat ramp. Sat down. Contemplated my situation.

I put my headphones on and played a song—"Word of God Speak" by MercyMe—over and over and over. And I wept completely, from the deepest part of my inner being.

*I'm finding myself at a loss for words*
*And the funny thing is it's okay*
*The last thing I need is to be heard*
*But to hear what You would say*

*Word of God speak*
*Would You pour down like rain*
*Washing my eyes to see*
*Your majesty*
*To be still and know*
*That You're in this place*
*Please let me stay and rest*
*In Your holiness*
*Word of God speak*

What happened next? I guess I'll just say: I received my miracle.

I stepped off the end of the road and started walking toward the water. With each step, I asked the Holy Spirit to embrace me. Asked God to give me a much-needed miracle in my life.

I put my feet into the water. The Living Water's Edge.

And I was comforted in knowing: it's going to be okay.

The water didn't recoil from my shame. It didn't reject the mess I'd made. It received me. Cool, real, life-giving.

That's grace. Not the reward for cleaning up. The power that cleanses.

## Original Writing from the Blog

Have you ever wanted a miracle
But felt unworthy to plead

Have you felt like a lost cause
weighed down, never to be freed

All you could do was crawl in a hole
Never to be heard from or seen

Giving up a life of purpose
Giving up hope to be clean

Shouting out to God in your anger
Why not me Lord, why am I not deserving

If you were truly a God of love and compassion
You are the one I would be serving

Walking away into the night
Your heart hardened, you have no regret

Your hopes crushed to have a Savior
Someone who loves you, who will pay your debt

---

Have you ever seen a miracle
in the life of another soul

Have you ever witnessed the gratitude
that comes by making one whole

It's a beauty that's indescribable
A gift from the One above

Filled with so much awe and wonder
It is truly a gift of love

That gift is yours for the taking
All you have to do is ask

But you will never be able to come clean
If you continue to wear your mask

How do you break free from yourself
From the bondage that's keeping you a slave

You have to lift your hands to the one above
For He is the only one who can save

Come to the living water's edge
And feel the power of healing

It is a miracle you can receive
The love of the Savior revealing

You will be free from your own bondage
To be made whole again

Give Him your burden, completely your burden
He will cleanse you from all your sin

Have you ever seen a miracle
in the life of your own soul

Have you ever poured out your gratitude
that comes by making you whole

It's a beauty that's indescribable
A gift from the One above

Filled with so much awe and wonder
It is truly a gift of love

## Song Integration

I wrote this piece after I'd been wrestling with unworthiness for months—maybe years, if I'm honest. Watching other people experience breakthrough, healing, transformation. Hearing their testimonies of miracles. Witnessing the joy that comes when someone is made whole.

And feeling... nothing. Except the growing conviction that miracles were for other people. Not for me.

I felt like a lost cause. Weighed down by shame so heavy I could barely breathe. The kind of shame that makes you want to crawl into a hole and never be seen again. That makes you give up on purpose, on hope, on the possibility of ever being clean.

I was angry at God. I shouted at Him in the darkness: "Why not me, Lord? Why am I not deserving? If You were truly a God of love and compassion, You are the one I would be serving. But You're not showing up for me. So why should I keep trying?"

I walked away that night. Heart hardened. No regret. Or so I told myself.

But the hardness was a lie. Underneath it was crushing hope—hope that there could be a Savior who actually loved me, who would actually pay my debt. Hope that had been beaten down so many times it had learned to hide behind anger.

The turning point came when I stopped looking at my own unworthiness and started looking at the miracle happening in someone else's life. I watched a friend encounter grace in a way I'd never seen. Watched them pour out gratitude. Watched them be made whole.

And something in me whispered: That gift is yours for the taking too. All you have to do is ask.

But I couldn't ask. Because I was still wearing my mask. Still pretending I had it together. Still performing rather than being real.

How do you break free from yourself? From the bondage that keeps you enslaved to shame and performance and the need to look good?

You have to lift your hands to the One above. You have to come to the living water's edge. You have to stop trying to save yourself and let the only One who can save actually do it.

This writing became my permission slip. Permission to admit I wanted a miracle. Permission to confess I felt unworthy. Permission to take off the mask and come to the water's edge as I actually was—broken, desperate, thirsty.

The song came later, as these raw confessions transformed into declaration. The writing asks questions: Have you ever wanted a miracle? Have you ever seen one? The song answers: Come to the living water's edge. The miracle is available. The Savior is revealing His love. You can be made whole.

The writing is the struggle. The song is the breakthrough.

## Reflections for the Road

These aren't homework. They're invitations. Gentle questions to help you engage with your own thirst, your own need for living water.

**Questions for the Journey:**

1. **Where are you with the water? Still in the swamp? At the edge? Already in, being washed?**

   Be honest about where you actually are, not where you think you should be. If you're still in the swamp, that's okay. If you're at the edge but afraid to step in, that's okay too. Grace meets you where you are.

2. **What's keeping you from stepping into the water? Fear? Shame? Unworthiness? The belief that you have to clean up first?**

   Name the obstacle. Shame loses its power when it's brought into the light. Fear shrinks when it's spoken aloud. What's the lie you're believing about grace?

3. **Read John 4 slowly. Put yourself in the woman's place. What does Jesus see in you? What does He offer?**

   This isn't theological study. This is personal encounter. Imagine yourself at the well. Imagine Jesus asking you for a drink. Imagine Him seeing everything you've ever done—and offering you living water anyway.

4. **What would it mean to stop trying to clean yourself up and just come to the water?**

   What would change if you stopped performing? Stopped trying to earn grace? Stopped waiting to be good enough? What if you came as you are—right now, in this moment, with all your mess—and let grace wash you?

## Practice: The Water Ritual

If possible, find actual water. A river, a lake, the ocean, even a bathtub. If none of those are accessible, a bowl of water will do. The physical act helps the spiritual truth sink in.

Take off your shoes. If you're at a river or lake or ocean, step in. Feel the water on your feet, your ankles. If you're at a bathtub, fill it and step in. If you're using a bowl, dip your hands in.

Feel the water. Cool or warm. Flowing or still. Just feel it. Let yourself be present to the sensation.

Pray this prayer, or something like it in your own words:

"God, I come to the water. I can't clean myself up. I've tried and I've failed and I'm tired of trying. But I believe You can wash me. I receive Your grace. I receive Your living water. Wash me. Make me clean. Fill me with Your Spirit. Let rivers of living water flow from within me."

Cup water in your hands if you're at a natural body of water or using a bowl. Pour it over your head, your arms, your feet. Each time, whisper: "Grace."

If you're in a bathtub, dunk yourself under. Go all the way under, if you can. Stay under for a moment. Let it be a death—a burial of the old self, the shame, the performance, the unworthiness. Then come up. Resurrection. New life. New creation.

The physical act matters. Jesus used physical water in baptism for a reason. We're embodied beings. We need to feel grace, not just think about it.

So feel the water. Let it wash over you. Let it be a tangible reminder: Grace is real. Living water is real. And it's available to you.

## Closing Image

You're standing in the water now. Not all the way in—just ankles deep. Just enough to feel it's real. Cool and shocking and clean.

The mud from the swamp is starting to wash away. Not instantly. Not all at once. But gradually. With each step deeper, more of it lifts off. Carried downstream by the current.

You look down at your feet. You can see them through the water. Clear. The stones beneath them smooth and solid.

You look at your hands. Still muddy. But less than before.

You cup water and pour it over your arms. Watch the mud run off in brown streams. Underneath: skin. Your actual skin. You'd almost forgotten what it looked like.

You're still a mess. You're still covered in swamp. But you're also being washed. Both are true at the same time.

*Take a breath.*

This is the water's edge. Not instant transformation. The beginning of transformation. Not immediate perfection. The start of healing.

You take another step. The water rises to your knees. Colder. Stronger current. But also... invigorating. Alive.

You're wading in. One step at a time. Letting the water do what you could never do for yourself.

And somewhere deep inside, beneath the shame and the fear and the exhaustion, something stirs. Something that feels almost like... hope.

Not the fragile, easily crushed hope you've known before. But something sturdier. Something rooted not in your ability to clean yourself up, but in the water's ability to wash you.

Living water.

You're at the water's edge. And you're wading in. And it's the beginning of everything.
