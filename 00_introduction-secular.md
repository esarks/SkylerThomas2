# Dying Changes Everything: A Wayfarer's Journey (Introduction)

## The Wayfarer's Anthem

*"I used to think love was something I earned. Then I met it in a swamp. Covered in mud, gasping for air, convinced I was too far gone—that's when I felt it. Not a rescue that pulled me out immediately, but a presence that sat with me in the muck and whispered, 'I'm here. I've been here the whole time. And I'm not leaving.'"*

## Who This Book Is For (And What It's Really About)

Let me tell you what isn't working.

The way you've been living? It's exhausting you. The performance. The hustle. The constant striving to prove you're enough. The relationships that drain more than they fill. The achievements that feel hollow an hour after you get them. The nights lying awake wondering, "Is this all there is?"

You might not even realize it yet. You might think, "This is just how life is. Everyone struggles like this, right?"

Wrong.

There's another way. A better way. And you don't have to figure it out alone.

---

**If you've never been to church**, that's okay. You might actually have an advantage—fewer bad experiences to unlearn.

**If you walked away from church years ago**, I get it. I did too. The institution failed a lot of us. But this isn't about going back to what hurt you.

**If you're not sure you even believe in God**, stick with me. I'm not asking you to sign a statement of faith. I'm inviting you into a story—mine, and maybe yours—about what happens when you stop pretending and start being honest.

Here's the thing: I'm going to talk about God. About Jesus. About finding something real in the middle of the mess.

But I'm not going to ask you to believe it all right now. I'm just asking you to consider: *What if there's a Love that meets you exactly where you are? What if you don't have to clean yourself up first? What if the brokenness you're carrying is the exact place where healing begins?*

**This is what I mean by "spirituality" instead of "religion":**

Religion says: Follow the rules, perform well, measure up, and maybe you'll be acceptable.

Spirituality says: You're already known. Already seen. Already loved. Now come find out what that means.

I talk about **God** not as some distant cosmic force or angry judge, but as the source of the love you've been searching for your whole life. The kind of love that doesn't depend on your performance. That doesn't quit when you mess up. That runs toward you, not away from you.

I talk about **Jesus** not as a religious figure on a stained-glass window, but as God choosing to step into human skin. To live our life. To feel our pain. To show us what Love looks like with hands and feet. He didn't come to start a religion. He came for people who were drowning—people like you and me.

I talk about **the Spirit** not as some spooky religious concept, but as the presence of God that can actually live in you. That whispers truth when you're believing lies. That gives you strength when you have none left. That transforms you from the inside out.

**Why would any of this matter to you?**

Because you've tried everything else.

You've tried achieving your way to meaning. Working harder. Making more money. Finding the right relationship. Filling the void with whatever you could find. And if you're honest, it's all come up short.

Not because you're doing it wrong. But because you were designed for something deeper. Something that doesn't break when life breaks. Something that doesn't end when your heart stops.

An old theologian named Augustine said it like this: *"Our hearts are restless until they rest in You."*

That restlessness you feel? That ache for more? That's not a flaw. That's your soul telling you there's something real to find.

**Here's what I'm NOT doing:**

I'm not trying to get you to join a church (though finding a good community later might help).

I'm not asking you to become religious (please don't).

I'm not going to quote a bunch of Bible verses at you like proof-texts (though I will tell you some ancient stories that might surprise you).

**Here's what I AM doing:**

I'm inviting you to consider that the God you might have given up on never gave up on you.

I'm showing you what it looked like when I stopped running and started being honest.

I'm suggesting that the swamp you're in might be the exact place where you finally meet Love.

**If you're thinking:** *"I don't know if I buy any of this God stuff..."*

Good. Questions are allowed here. Doubt is part of the journey. You don't have to have it all figured out to keep reading.

**If you're thinking:** *"I've been hurt by religious people..."*

I'm sorry. Truly. The system fails people all the time. Hypocrites are real. Church can wound. But please don't confuse the failure of religious people with who God actually is.

**If you're thinking:** *"Why should I give this a try?"*

Because you picked up this book for a reason. Something in you is still searching. Still hoping. Still wondering if there might be more.

And I'm here to tell you: there is.

Not religion. Not performance. Not rules.

But a Love that wades into your swamp.

A grace that meets you exactly where you are.

A Life that doesn't end when this one does.

**This book is for the messy, the broken, the burned-out, the skeptical, the searching.**

It's for people who know they don't have it all together and are tired of pretending otherwise.

If that's you, keep reading.

Let's walk together.

## Setting the Scene: The Crash

That's when I whispered it. The first honest thing I'd said in months:

*"I can't do this anymore."*

Eight words. Not eloquent. Not packaged for public consumption. But real. And honesty—raw, desperate honesty—would become my first step toward healing.

And then my world crumbled into pieces I could hardly recognize.

---

## The Crisis and the Promise

**The Crisis:** It was more than burnout. It was a moral breakdown—an unraveling of the life I'd tried to hold together. My performance-based identity collapsed, and I crossed boundaries those closest to me could not accept. As a leader, husband, and father, I lost the trust that defined my identity. What remained was shame, emptiness, and the desperate hope that I could still be loved.

**The Promise:** Love meets us exactly where we are. Not where we should be. Not where we pretend to be. Exactly where we are—mud and all.

## My Story of Burnout

I remember a season when everything looked right from the outside. We were deeply involved in our community, leading groups, teaching classes. People looked to us as examples of service and commitment. But underneath all the activity, relationships were fracturing in ways I couldn't control or understand.

At work, there was conflict I couldn't navigate—conversations that somehow always went sideways, no matter how carefully I tried. My boss pulled me aside one day with words that landed like a punch: the dynamic wasn't working, and I was part of the problem. At home, the tension was even worse—the kind you can feel in the air before anyone says a word.

I was trying so hard to prepare meaningful lessons and lead well. Pouring hours into teaching, into creating content, into showing up for people. But internally, I was drowning. Wondering if I could make any of it work. Wondering if anyone noticed that I was falling apart.

Then the facade crumbled. What I'd been hiding—what I'd managed to keep in the shadows while maintaining the appearance of having it all together—could no longer stay hidden. And the institution I'd trusted, the community I'd served so faithfully, didn't know how to handle brokenness. There were no resources for restoration, only consequences. Instead of healing, I heard condemnation. Instead of compassion, I felt rejection.

It felt like friendly fire—wounded by the very people who were supposed to help carry my burdens. The ancient wisdom says, "Carry each other's burdens." Instead of being carried, I was crushed.

So I walked away. Into the swamp of shame, isolation, and despair. Into a place where the questions were bigger than the answers and the pain was more real than the platitudes.

Henri Nouwen, the brilliant theologian and writer who himself walked through seasons of severe depression, named what I was experiencing:

> "There is a deep hole in your being, like an abyss. You will never succeed in filling that hole, because your needs are inexhaustible... You have to work around it so that gradually the abyss closes. Since the hole is so deep and your anguish so total, you run away from it, afraid that you will fall into it."
>
> — Henri Nouwen, *The Inner Voice of Love*

That abyss—that bottomless hole—I'd spent years trying to fill it with religious performance, community approval, maintaining the image, and working more hours to accomplish tasks in order to make me feel better about myself. But in the swamp, I was too tired to run. And I no longer resisted moral temptation. Now I had to look at it. I had to face what I'd been avoiding.

*Take a breath.*

Maybe you can't relate to my specific story. The details might be different. But perhaps you know someone who's walked a similar path—or maybe you've walked a different path with the same ending: wounded to the point of wanting out. Standing in the wreckage of a broken world where the pieces seemingly can't be put back together.

That's where this journey begins. Not in victory, but in the swamp. Not with all the answers, but with the honesty to admit we don't have them.

### The Years of Performance

For years, I'd been what Brennan Manning called "the impostor"—the false self shaped by others' expectations rather than authentic inner promptings. Manning wrote:

> "The impostor is a liar, a phony, a hypocrite. It is the self presented to the world to gain approval, to win esteem, to be admired. But it's not who you really are. Living as an impostor means living a lie... And here's the brutal truth: the impostor thrives in religious settings."
>
> — Brennan Manning, *Abba's Child*

I was the class leader who felt nothing. The group leader giving advice I didn't believe. The person quoting wisdom while drowning in doubt. The "strong one" who was actually drowning.

The years of 'successful' leadership and hard-working achievement kept accumulating. More money. Recognition. People saying, "Your teaching has really helped me." Being looked at as a technical expert at work. And all the while, the exhaustion grew beneath the performance like water seeping into a foundation, slowly undermining everything.

Then came the specific moment when the façade cracked. I can still see it clearly—the counseling session where I finally said out loud: "I don't know if I believe any of this anymore." The words hung in the air like a confession at a trial. And I waited for condemnation.

But what came instead was terrifying freedom. The freedom of admitting: "I can't do this anymore."

## The Journey Metaphor: Three Movements

This book follows three movements—three stages of the journey from performance to authenticity, from drowning to dancing, from the swamp to the unforced rhythms of life.

### Movement 1: The Swamp

This is where we're stuck. The quicksand of shame, the muck of failure, the waters of despair rising.

Let me be specific about what a real swamp is like. I took photos at Sawgrass Lake Park in St. Petersburg, Florida—a place where I often went to reflect, to grieve, to be honest with myself.

**Sight:** Dark water, murky and opaque. You can't see your feet. Can't see what's underneath. Can't see the way out. The light filtering through the cypress canopy is weak, greenish, sickly.

**Smell:** Rot. Stagnation. The smell of things dying slowly. Decomposition. The earth breaking down what was once alive.

**Sound:** The buzz of insects. The occasional splash that makes you jump—alligator? snake? something worse? Mostly, though, silence. Heavy, oppressive silence.

**Touch:** The muck. It clings to you. Pulls at you. Everything feels heavy—your clothes, your limbs, your thoughts. Each step is exhausting.

**Taste:** You can taste the swamp in the back of your throat. Bitter. Like drinking failure.

This isn't just depression (though it might include that). This isn't just spiritual dryness (though that's part of it). This is the accumulated weight of years of performing instead of being, conversations that felt hollow, service that felt like work, community that felt like critique, meaning that became a burden instead of a gift.

The ancient psalmist knew this place:

> *"Save me, for the waters have come up to my neck. I sink in the miry depths, where there is no foothold. I have come into the deep waters; the floods engulf me. I am worn out calling for help; my throat is parched. My eyes fail, looking for hope."*

Worn out calling for help. That's the swamp.

*Pause and consider: Have you ever felt this way? That sinking feeling, the exhaustion of trying to keep it all together?*

Why spend so many chapters talking about the swamp? Because it isn't a niche struggle; it's epidemic. The swamp shows up everywhere—in the writings of Nouwen, Manning, Lewis, Frankl, Brené Brown, Pema Chödrön—because it is the universal human condition. It's so common that many never even stop to name it. For some, it becomes the assumed backdrop of life: heavy, stagnant, normal. Others rationalize it, assuming that true depth requires long seasons of despair. And candidly, there are millions who don't even realize life doesn't have to be this way. They've made peace with the swamp because they've never glimpsed the possibility of another kind of life. That's why it matters to pause here. Because until we name the swamp for what it is, we can't imagine leaving it.

### Movement 2: The Water's Edge

The transition space. You've dragged yourself (or been dragged) out of the swamp. Now you're at the edge of something clean, something clear. Living water. The kind that refreshes, that quenches real thirst, that becomes a spring within you.

But you're terrified to step in because you're filthy. Covered in swamp muck. Reeking of failure and shame. You're convinced the water will reject you. That you need to clean up first before you can approach.

This is where love does its most subversive work. Where you discover that the invitation isn't "Clean yourself up and then come." It's "Come as you are, and restoration will find you."

An ancient letter put it this way: *"But because of great love for us, the Source of all mercy made us alive even when we were dead in our broken patterns—it is by radical kindness you have been saved."* Even when we were dead. Even when we were in the swamp. That's when healing came.

### Movement 3: Unforced Rhythms of Life

Life after surrender. Not perfection, but participation. Not arrival, but walking.

There's an ancient invitation that speaks to this:

> *"Are you tired? Worn out? Burned out on religion? Come to me. Get away with me and you'll recover your life. I'll show you how to take a real rest. Walk with me and work with me—watch how I do it. Learn the unforced rhythms of grace."*
>
> — From an ancient spiritual text (The Message translation)

Unforced rhythms—that's what this final movement is about. Picture someone who's learned to swim—or better yet, learned to float. Still in the water, but no longer fighting it. No longer exhausting yourself trying to stay afloat through sheer effort. Learning to rest in the water that holds you.

Dallas Willard described it this way:

> "Grace is not opposed to effort; it is opposed to earning. Earning is an attitude. Effort is an action. You cannot earn transformation by trying harder. But you can position yourself where transformation happens—in the stream of grace."
>
> — Dallas Willard, *The Great Omission*

The unforced rhythms don't mean passivity. They mean learning to cooperate with life rather than trying to manufacture it through performance.

## Setting Expectations

This isn't a how-to book. I don't have five steps to fix your life. What I have is a story—mine, and maybe yours too. What I have is fifteen songs that became fifteen chapters that became a map through the swamp.

What I have is the conviction that love is real, that it's for wayfarers like us, and that it meets us exactly where we are.

As C.S. Lewis wrote:

> "The broken human is not simply an imperfect creature who needs improvement: we are rebels who must lay down our arms. Laying down your arms, surrendering, saying you are sorry, realizing that you have been on the wrong track and getting ready to start life over again from the ground up—that is the only way out of our 'hole.'"

This book is about laying down arms. About surrendering the self-salvation project. About admitting we've been on the wrong track and getting ready to start over.

It's about discovering what the ancient teacher Paul discovered: *"When I am weak, then I am strong."* That the swamp—the place of weakness, brokenness, and desperation—is exactly where transformation happens.

## The Songs as Spiritual Markers

Each chapter centers on a song. These aren't illustrations of the teaching—they're the heart of it. Each song was written in a specific season, in a specific struggle, and became a waypoint on the journey. The book is the story behind the songs, and the songs are the soundtrack of healing.

When you reach each chapter, I'll invite you to listen first, read second. Let the music do what music does—bypass your defenses and touch the ache directly. Then we'll unpack it together.

The ancient Psalms taught me this. They're not theological treatises set to music. They're prayers that became songs, laments that became worship, honest cries that became sacred text. David didn't write about crying out in the cave; he cried out, and that cry became a psalm.

These fifteen songs are my psalms: imperfect, incomplete, but honest. And honesty is where healing begins.

---

## Key Truth: Love in the Muck

Here's the scandalous truth that changes everything:

**Love doesn't wait for you to clean up. It wades into the muck with you. And here's the scandal: it calls that muck 'holy ground,' because anywhere you finally meet your true self IS holy ground—swamp mud and all.**

Remember the ancient story of Moses at the burning bush? The voice said, *"Take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy ground."* Moses was standing in the wilderness, tending sheep, running from his past. Not in a temple. Not in a place of worship. In the wilderness. And the voice said: This is holy ground.

The swamp becomes holy ground when you meet truth there. Not because the swamp is good. But because honesty enters it. And wherever honesty is becomes sacred.

An ancient truth captures this: *"Love shows itself in this: While we were still broken, restoration came for us."*

While we were still. Not after we cleaned up. Not once we got our act together. Not when we finally believed hard enough. **While we were still.** In the swamp. In the muck. In the middle of our mess.

---

## The Wayfarer Identity

Who is a wayfarer? Someone on a journey, often weary. A pilgrim, a traveler, a wanderer. Not someone who has arrived, but someone honest enough to admit they're still on the road. Not someone perfect, but someone willing to keep walking.

The metaphor of journey saturates human wisdom:

- Abraham, called to leave everything familiar and go to a land he would discover as he went
- Ancient peoples, wandering years in the wilderness learning to trust
- Jesus, who had no place to lay his head
- The early spiritual seekers, who called their path "The Way"
- Ancient writers who described believers as "foreigners and strangers on earth" seeking "a better country"

Wayfarers know:

- **The road is long and we're not there yet** — We're still becoming who we're meant to be
- **We'll walk through swamps, deserts, and dark valleys** — Ancient wisdom promises the valley, not just green pastures
- **We don't travel alone** — The promise: *"I am with you always"*
- **The point isn't arrival; it's learning to walk authentically** — The call is to "walk humbly"
- **Authenticity matters more than appearance** — *"People look at the outward appearance, but the heart is what matters"*
- **Questions are allowed, doubt is part of the journey** — Even the faithful sent messengers asking, *"Are you the one, or should we expect someone else?"*
- **We're all just beggars telling other beggars where to find bread** — Martin Luther

Richard Rohr describes this wayfaring path:

> "The spiritual life is not a life of success but a life of faithfulness. It's not about never falling, but about getting back up. It's not about perfection, but about direction."
>
> — Richard Rohr, *Falling Upward*

## Closing Image: The Traveler at the Trailhead

Picture a traveler at the beginning of a long road. Pack on their back, mud on their boots, questions in their hearts.

They don't know exactly where the road leads. They don't know how long it will take. They don't know what they'll encounter along the way.

But they know two things:

1. They can't stay in the swamp.
2. They don't have to walk alone.

Augustine, reflecting on his own journey from the swamp to wholeness, wrote these now-famous words:

> "You have made us for yourself, O Lord, and our hearts are restless until they rest in you."
>
> — Augustine of Hippo, *Confessions*

That restlessness is mercy. It's your soul refusing to settle for substitutes, calling you out of the swamp and onto the road.

So we begin. Not with answers, but with honesty. Not with arrival, but with willingness to walk.

The journey is long. But love is real.

And the Wayfarer's Anthem is this: **I can't do this alone. But I don't have to.**

Let's walk together.
