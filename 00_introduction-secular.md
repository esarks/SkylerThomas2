# Out of the Swamp: How I Found Truth (Introduction)

*Last updated: 2025-10-11 19:28:07*

## The Wayfarer's Anthem

*"I used to think love was something I earned. Then I met it in a swamp. Covered in mud, gasping for air, convinced I was too far gone—that's when I felt it. Not a rescue that pulled me out immediately, but a presence that sat with me in the muck and whispered, 'I'm here. I've been here the whole time. And I'm not leaving.'"*

---

## Who This Book Is For (And What It's Really About)

Are you tired? Not just physically tired—soul tired. The kind of tired that sleep doesn't fix.

Do you ever lie awake at night wondering if there's more to life than what you're experiencing? Do the achievements feel hollow? Do the relationships feel exhausting? Does the constant striving to prove you're enough feel... well, like it's never enough?

If any of that resonates, this book might be for you.

Because here's what I've discovered: there's another way to live. Not perfect. Not easy. But different. Better. More real.

And you don't have to figure it out alone.

---

Now, I need to be honest with you about something: this is a book about finding something more. And that "something more" is a spiritual connection—but probably not the kind you're thinking of.

This isn't about religion. It's not about joining a church or converting to any particular faith tradition. But yes, I'm going to introduce you to some faith-based authors. Yes, I'll cite passages from the Holy Bible. Because these ancient texts and thinkers have mapped this journey before us, and their wisdom matters.

Here's what this book IS about: introducing you to a God who created you and loves you exactly where you are right now. Not where you should be. Not where you wish you were. Right where you are.

**If you've never been to church**, that's okay. You might actually have an advantage—fewer bad experiences to unlearn.

**If you walked away from church years ago**, I get it. I did too. The institution failed a lot of us. But this isn't about going back to what hurt you.

**If you're not sure you even believe in God**, stick with me. I'm not asking you to sign a statement of faith. I'm inviting you into a story—mine, and maybe yours—about what happens when you stop pretending and start being honest.

Here's the thing: I'm going to talk about God. About Jesus. About finding something real in the middle of the mess.

But I'm not going to ask you to believe it all right now. I'm just asking you to consider: *What if there's a Love that meets you exactly where you are? What if you don't have to clean yourself up first? What if the brokenness you're carrying is the exact place where healing begins?*

**This is what I mean by "spirituality" instead of "religion":**

Religion says: Follow the rules, perform well, measure up, and maybe you'll be acceptable.

Spirituality says: You're already known. Already seen. Already loved. Now come find out what that means.

I talk about **God** not as some distant cosmic force or angry judge, but as the source of the love you've been searching for your whole life. The kind of love that doesn't depend on your performance. That doesn't quit when you mess up. That runs toward you, not away from you.

I talk about **Jesus** not as a religious figure on a stained-glass window, but as God choosing to step into human skin. To live our life. To feel our pain. To show us what Love looks like with hands and feet. He didn't come to start a religion. He came for people who were drowning—people like you and me.

I talk about **the Spirit** not as some spooky religious concept, but as the presence of God that can actually live in you. That whispers truth when you're believing lies. That gives you strength when you have none left. That transforms you from the inside out.

**Why would any of this matter to you?**

Because maybe you've tried everything else.

Maybe you've tried achieving your way to meaning. Working harder. Making more money. Finding the right relationship. Filling the void with whatever you could find. Maybe you've even tried to just be a better person through morality (whatever that is). And if you're honest, it's all come up short.

Not because you're doing it wrong. But because you were designed for something deeper. Something that doesn't break when life breaks. Something that doesn't end when your heart stops.

An old theologian named Augustine said it like this: *"Our hearts are restless until they rest in You."*

That restlessness you feel? That ache for more? That's not a flaw. That's your soul telling you there's something real to find.

**Here's what I'm NOT doing:**

I'm not trying to get you to join a church (though finding a good community later might help).

I'm not asking you to become religious (please don't).

I'm not going to quote a bunch of Bible verses at you like proof-texts (though I will tell you some ancient stories that might surprise you).

**Here's what I AM doing:**

I'm inviting you to consider that the God you might have given up on never gave up on you.

I'm showing you what it looked like when I stopped running and started being honest.

I'm suggesting that the swamp you're in might be the exact place where you finally meet Love.

**If you're thinking:** *"I don't know if I buy any of this God stuff..."*

Good. Questions are allowed here. Doubt is part of the journey. You don't have to have it all figured out to keep reading.

**If you're thinking:** *"I've been hurt by religious people..."*

I'm sorry. Truly. The system fails people all the time. Hypocrites are real. Church can wound. But please don't confuse the failure of religious people with who God actually is.

**If you're thinking:** *"Why should I give this a try?"*

Because you picked up this book for a reason. Something in you is still searching. Still hoping. Still wondering if there might be more.

And I'm here to tell you: I believe there is.

Not religion. Not performance. Not rules.

But a Love that wades into your swamp.

A grace that meets you exactly where you are.

A Life that doesn't end when this one does.

**This book is for the messy, the broken, the burned-out, the skeptical, the searching.**

It's for people who know they don't have it all together and are tired of pretending otherwise.

If that's you, keep reading.

Let's walk together.

---

## Setting the Scene: The Crash

You know that moment when you can't keep pretending anymore?

For me, it came in whispers:

*"I can't do this anymore."*

Eight words. Not eloquent. Not packaged. Just real.

And honesty—raw, desperate honesty—became my first step toward something better.

Then my world crumbled into pieces I could hardly recognize.

---

## The Crisis and the Promise

It was more than burnout. It was a moral breakdown—an unraveling of the life I'd tried to hold together. My performance-based identity collapsed. I crossed boundaries those closest to me couldn't accept. As a leader, husband, and father, I lost the trust that defined my identity.

What remained? Shame. Emptiness. And the desperate hope that I could still be loved.

But here's what I discovered:

Love meets us exactly where we are. Not where we should be. Not where we pretend to be. Exactly where we are—mud and all.

---

## My Story of Burnout

Everything looked right from the outside. Working harder. Mentoring people at work. Involvement in community. Being a good family man. People looked to me as an example of service and commitment.

But underneath? Relationships fracturing in ways I couldn't control or understand.

At work, conflict I couldn't navigate. Conversations that went sideways no matter how carefully I tried. My boss pulled me aside one day with words that landed like a punch: the dynamic wasn't working, and I was part of the problem. What?!  I had no idea.  But surely I could have recognized the signs.

At home? Even worse. The kind of tension you can feel in the air before anyone says a word.

I was trying so hard. Pouring hours into teaching. Creating content. Showing up for people. But internally? Drowning. Wondering if I could make any of it work. Wondering if anyone noticed I was falling apart.

Then the facade crumbled.

What I'd been hiding—what I'd managed to keep in the shadows while maintaining the appearance of having it all together—could no longer stay hidden.

And the institution I'd trusted? The community I'd served so faithfully? They didn't know how to handle brokenness. No resources for restoration. Only consequences. Instead of healing, I heard condemnation. Instead of compassion, I felt rejection.

It felt like friendly fire—wounded by the very people who were supposed to carry my burdens. The ancient wisdom says, "Carry each other's burdens." Instead of being carried, I was crushed.

So I walked away.

Into the swamp of shame, isolation, and despair. Into a place where the questions were bigger than the answers and the pain was more real than the platitudes.

Henri Nouwen, the brilliant writer who himself walked through seasons of severe depression, named what I was experiencing:

> "There is a deep hole in your being, like an abyss. You will never succeed in filling that hole, because your needs are inexhaustible... You have to work around it so that gradually the abyss closes. Since the hole is so deep and your anguish so total, you run away from it, afraid that you will fall into it."
>
> — Henri Nouwen, *The Inner Voice of Love*

That abyss—that bottomless hole—I'd spent years trying to fill it with performance of hard work and good deeds, community approval, maintaining the image, and working more hours to accomplish tasks in order to make me feel better about myself. But in the swamp, I was too tired to run. And I no longer resisted moral temptation. Now I had to look at it. I had to face what I'd been avoiding.

Maybe you can't relate to my specific story. The details might be different.

But perhaps you know someone who's walked a similar path. Or maybe you've walked a different path with the same ending: wounded to the point of wanting out. Standing in the wreckage where the pieces can't be put back together.

That's where this journey begins.

Not in victory, but in the swamp. Not with all the answers, but with the honesty to admit we don't have them.

### The Years of Performance

For years, I'd been what one writer called "the impostor"—the false self shaped by others' expectations rather than who I really was. He wrote:

> "The impostor is a liar, a phony, a hypocrite. It is the self presented to the world to gain approval, to win esteem, to be admired. But it's not who you really are. Living as an impostor means living a lie..."
>
> — Brennan Manning, *Abba's Child*

That was me.

As "a leader" who felt nothing. I was giving advice I didn't believe. The person quoting wisdom while drowning in doubt. The "strong one" who was actually drowning.

The years kept accumulating. More money. Recognition. People saying, "Your teaching has really helped me." Being seen as a technical expert at work. And all the while, the exhaustion grew beneath the performance like water seeping into a foundation, slowly undermining everything.

Then came the moment when the façade cracked.

I can still see it clearly—the counseling session where I finally said out loud: "I don't know if I believe any of this anymore."

The words hung in the air like a confession at a trial.

I waited for condemnation.

But what came instead was terrifying freedom. The freedom of admitting: "I can't do this anymore."

## The Journey Metaphor: Three Movements

So where does this journey take us?

This book follows three movements—three stages of the journey from performance to authenticity, from drowning to dancing, from the swamp to the unforced rhythms of life.

### Movement 1: The Swamp

This is where we're stuck. The quicksand of shame. The muck of failure. The waters of despair rising.

Dark water you can't see through. The smell of rot. Heavy silence. Muck that clings and pulls. Everything exhausting.

This isn't just depression (though it might include that). This isn't just spiritual dryness (though that's part of it).

This is the accumulated weight of years of performing instead of being. Conversations that felt hollow. Service that felt like work. Community that felt like critique. Meaning that became a burden instead of a gift.

An ancient writer knew this place:

> *"Save me, O God, for the floodwaters are up to my neck. Deeper and deeper I sink into the mire; I can't find a foothold. I am in deep water, and the floods overwhelm me. I am exhausted from crying for help; my throat is parched. My eyes are swollen with weeping, waiting for my God to help me."*
>
> — Psalm 69:1-3 (NLT)

Worn out calling for help.

That's the swamp.

*Pause and consider: Have you ever felt this way? That sinking feeling, the exhaustion of trying to keep it all together?*

Why spend so many chapters talking about the swamp?

Because it isn't a niche struggle—it's epidemic. The swamp shows up everywhere. In the writings of thinkers across centuries. Because it is the universal human condition.

It's so common that many never even stop to name it. For some, it becomes the assumed backdrop of life: heavy, stagnant, normal. Others rationalize it, assuming that true depth requires long seasons of despair.

And candidly? There are millions who don't even realize life doesn't have to be this way. They've made peace with the swamp because they've never glimpsed the possibility of another kind of life.

That's why it matters to pause here.

Because until we name the swamp for what it is, we can't imagine leaving it.

### Movement 2: The Water's Edge

The transition space.

You've dragged yourself (or been dragged) out of the swamp. Now you're at the edge of something clean, something clear. Living water. The kind that refreshes. That quenches real thirst. That becomes a spring within you.

But you're terrified to step in.

Why? Because you're filthy. Covered in swamp muck. Reeking of failure and shame. You're convinced the water will reject you. That you need to clean up first before you can approach.

This is where love does its most subversive work.

Where you discover that the invitation isn't "Clean yourself up and then come."

It's "Come as you are, and restoration will find you."

An ancient letter put it this way: *"But because of great love for us, the Source of all mercy made us alive even when we were dead in our broken patterns—it is by radical kindness you have been saved."*

Even when we were dead. Even when we were in the swamp.

That's when healing came.

### Movement 3: Unforced Rhythms of Life

Life after surrender.

Not perfection, but participation. Not arrival, but walking.

There's an ancient invitation that speaks to this:

> *"Come to me, all of you who are weary and carry heavy burdens, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you. Let me teach you, because I am humble and gentle at heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy to bear, and the burden I give you is light."*
>
> — Matthew 11:28-30 (NLT)

Unforced rhythms—that's what this final movement is about.

Picture someone who's learned to swim—or better yet, learned to float. Still in the water, but no longer fighting it. No longer exhausting yourself trying to stay afloat through sheer effort. Learning to rest in the water that holds you.

One spiritual teacher captured the essence of what the world needs most:

> "The greatest issue facing the world today, with all its heartbreaking needs, is whether those who, by profession or culture, are identified as 'people of Christ' will become disciples—students, apprentices, practitioners—of Jesus Christ, steadily learning from him how to live the life of the Kingdom of the Heavens into every corner of human existence."
>
> — Dallas Willard, *The Great Omission*

The unforced rhythms are about becoming apprentices—not of a religious system, but of a way of life. Learning to live sustainably, authentically, in the flow of grace rather than the grind of performance.

## Setting Expectations

So what can you expect from this book?

This isn't a how-to book. I don't have five steps to fix your life.

What I have is a story—mine, and maybe yours too. What I have is fourteen songs that became fourteen chapters that became a map through the swamp.

What I have is the conviction that love is real, that it's for wayfarers like us, and that it meets us exactly where we are.

One writer put it this way:

> "The broken human is not simply an imperfect creature who needs improvement: we are rebels who must lay down our arms. Laying down your arms, surrendering, saying you are sorry, realizing that you have been on the wrong track and getting ready to start life over again from the ground up—that is the only way out of our 'hole.'"
>
> — C.S. Lewis

This book is about laying down arms.

About surrendering the self-salvation project. About admitting we've been on the wrong track and getting ready to start over.

It's about discovering what one ancient teacher discovered: *"When I am weak, then I am strong."*

That the swamp—the place of weakness, brokenness, and desperation—is exactly where transformation happens.

---

## The Songs as Spiritual Markers

Each chapter centers on a song.

These aren't illustrations of the teaching—they're the heart of it. Each song was written in a specific season, in a specific struggle, and became a waypoint on the journey. The book is the story behind the songs. The songs are the soundtrack of healing.

When you reach each chapter, I'll invite you to listen first, read second. Let the music do what music does—bypass your defenses and touch the ache directly. Then we'll unpack it together.

The ancient Psalms taught me this. They're not theological treatises set to music. They're prayers that became songs. Laments that became worship. Honest cries that became sacred text.

David didn't write about crying out in the cave. He cried out, and that cry became a psalm.

These fourteen songs are my psalms: imperfect, incomplete, but honest.

And honesty is where healing begins.

## Key Truth: Love in the Muck

**A Word About "Scandal"**

Throughout this book, I'm going to use the word "scandal" a lot. And I want you to understand why.

A scandal breaks the rules. It violates expectations. It offends sensibilities. It makes people uncomfortable because it doesn't fit the system they've built.

When I say love is "scandalous," I don't mean it's shocking in a tabloid sense. I mean it operates on principles that completely violate the economy we know—the economy of earning, deserving, performing, and paying back.

**The scandal is this:** In every system humans create, love has conditions. Acceptance has requirements. Forgiveness has limits. Acceptance has to be earned.

But love doesn't have to work that way.

Love says:
- "I love you when you're covered in swamp mud." (Scandalous—shouldn't I have to clean up first?)
- "I forgive you before you've proven you've changed." (Scandalous—shouldn't I have to earn it?)
- "I call you 'beloved' when you're still a mess." (Scandalous—shouldn't I have to deserve that title?)
- "I meet you in the muck and call it holy ground." (Scandalous—how can failure be holy?)

This is offensive to our sense of fairness. It violates our understanding of justice. It breaks every rule we have about how love should work.

**That's the scandal.**

Love isn't just nice. It's not just generous. It's revolutionary. Dangerous. World-upending.

If you could earn it, it wouldn't be free—it would be payment.
If you deserved it, it wouldn't be love—it would be obligation.
If you had to clean up first, it wouldn't be scandalous—it would be sensible.

But love doesn't do sensible. Love does scandalous.

Throughout this book, when you see the word "scandal," remember: it's not a problem. It's the point.

The scandal is what makes it love. The scandal is what makes it real. The scandal is what makes it for you.

Because if love only came to the deserving, you and I would still be in the swamp.

---

Here's the scandalous truth that changes everything:

**Love doesn't wait for you to clean up. It wades into the muck with you.**

And here's the scandal: it calls that muck 'holy ground.' Because anywhere you finally meet your true self IS holy ground—swamp mud and all.

Remember the ancient story of Moses at the burning bush? The voice said, *"Take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy ground."*

Moses was standing in the wilderness. Tending sheep. Running from his past. Not in a temple. Not in a place of worship. In the wilderness.

And the voice said: This is holy ground.

The swamp becomes holy ground when you meet truth there.

Not because the swamp is good. But because honesty enters it. And wherever honesty is becomes sacred.

An ancient truth captures this: *"Love shows itself in this: While we were still broken, restoration came for us."*

While we were still.

Not after we cleaned up. Not once we got our act together. Not when we finally believed hard enough.

**While we were still.**

In the swamp. In the muck. In the middle of our mess.

---

## The Wayfarer Identity

So who is a wayfarer?

Someone on a journey, often weary. A pilgrim. A traveler. A wanderer.

Not someone who has arrived, but someone honest enough to admit they're still on the road. Not someone perfect, but someone willing to keep walking.

The metaphor of journey saturates human wisdom:

- Abraham, called to leave everything familiar and go to a land he would discover as he went
- Ancient peoples, wandering years in the wilderness learning to trust
- Jesus, who had no place to lay his head
- The early spiritual seekers, who called their path "The Way"
- Ancient writers who described believers as "foreigners and strangers on earth" seeking "a better country"

Wayfarers know:

- **The road is long and we're not there yet** — We're still becoming who we're meant to be
- **We'll walk through swamps, deserts, and dark valleys** — Ancient wisdom promises the valley, not just green pastures
- **We don't travel alone** — The promise: *"I am with you always"*
- **The point isn't arrival; it's learning to walk authentically** — The call is to "walk humbly"
- **Authenticity matters more than appearance** — *"People look at the outward appearance, but the heart is what matters"*
- **Questions are allowed, doubt is part of the journey** — Even the faithful sent messengers asking, *"Are you the one, or should we expect someone else?"*
- **We're all just beggars telling other beggars where to find bread** — Martin Luther

One teacher describes this wayfaring path:

> "The spiritual life is not a life of success but a life of faithfulness. It's not about never falling, but about getting back up. It's not about perfection, but about direction."
>
> — Richard Rohr, *Falling Upward*

---

## Closing Image: The Traveler at the Trailhead

Picture a traveler at the beginning of a long road.

Pack on their back. Mud on their boots. Questions in their hearts.

They don't know exactly where the road leads. They don't know how long it will take. They don't know what they'll encounter along the way.

But they know two things:

1. They can't stay in the swamp.
2. They don't have to walk alone.

An ancient seeker, reflecting on his own journey from the swamp to wholeness, wrote these now-famous words:

> "You have made us for yourself, O Lord, and our hearts are restless until they rest in you."
>
> — Augustine of Hippo, *Confessions*

That restlessness is mercy.

It's your soul refusing to settle for substitutes, calling you out of the swamp and onto the road.

So we begin.

Not with answers, but with honesty. Not with arrival, but with willingness to walk.

The journey is long.

But love is real.

And the Wayfarer's Anthem is this: **I can't do this alone. But I don't have to.**

Let's walk together.
