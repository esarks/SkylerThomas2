## Summary
This document identifies quotes that are not properly formatted as block quotes in the manuscript files.

## Issues Found

### 1. Dallas Willard Quote Split Across Multiple Sections

**File:** `KDP/COMPLETE-MANUSCRIPT.md`
**Lines:** 909-915
**Issue:** A single Dallas Willard quote has been split into three parts, with only the middle section properly formatted as a block quote.

#### What It Currently Looks Like:

```markdown
Line 909: Dallas Willard explains why the swamp is so exhausting. We cannot transform ourselves. We cannot make ourselves into the people we need to be. Every self-help program, every technique, every discipline—pursued as self-salvation—will fail. Not because the practices are bad, but because we're asking them to do something they cannot do: save us.

Line 911: As Willard writes in *The Great Omission*:

Line 913: > "Grace is not opposed to effort; it is opposed to earning."

Line 915: You cannot earn transformation by trying harder. But you can position yourself where transformation happens.
```

#### How It Should Look (from original chapter file `02_chapter-01-my-swamp-secular.md`):

```markdown
One spiritual teacher explains why the swamp is so exhausting:

> "We cannot transform ourselves. We cannot make ourselves into the people we need to be. Every self-help program, every technique, every discipline—pursued as self-salvation—will fail. Not because the practices are bad, but because we're asking them to do something they cannot do: save us. Grace is not opposed to effort; it is opposed to earning. You cannot earn transformation by trying harder. But you can position yourself where transformation happens."
>
> — Dallas Willard, *The Great Omission*
```

#### What Needs to Be Fixed:

The entire quote should be formatted as a single block quote with the attribution at the end, as shown in the original chapter file.

**Current structure (incorrect):**
- Line 909: Regular text (should be block quote)
- Line 913: Block quote (correct, but incomplete)
- Line 915: Regular text (should be block quote)

**Should be:**
- One continuous block quote containing all three parts
- Attribution included within the block quote

### Complete Manuscript File
**1 issue found in KDP/COMPLETE-MANUSCRIPT.md**

The Dallas Willard quote at lines 909-915 is split incorrectly (see details above).

### Conclusion
The problem exists ONLY in the compiled COMPLETE-MANUSCRIPT.md file. All source chapter files are correctly formatted. This suggests the issue occurred during the compilation/assembly process of the complete manuscript.

## Action Items

- [ ] Fix the Dallas Willard quote in COMPLETE-MANUSCRIPT.md (lines 909-915)
- [ ] Verify the fix maintains consistency with the original chapter file format (02_chapter-01-my-swamp-secular.md:146-148)
- [ ] Consider regenerating COMPLETE-MANUSCRIPT.md from the source chapter files to prevent similar issues
