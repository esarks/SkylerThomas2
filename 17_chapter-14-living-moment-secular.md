### Chapter 14: Living in the Moment
**Based on:** "This Moment is Enough" (Devotional and Song)

**Opening Scene (2-3 pages):**

You're sitting at your kitchen table on a Sunday morning, coffee still steaming in your mug. No agenda today. Nowhere you have to be. Just... space.

A year ago, this would have terrified you. Empty space meant your mind would race to fill it—replaying yesterday's conversations you wish you'd handled differently, rehearsing tomorrow's scenarios that might never happen, catastrophizing outcomes that probably won't come to pass.

But this morning, you're just here. Hands wrapped around warm ceramic. The smell of coffee. Morning light slanting through the window. The sound of birds outside.

Present.

When did this become possible?

You think back to the person you were—always somewhere else mentally. Either stuck in the past, replaying and regretting, or anxious about the future, planning and preparing and trying to control outcomes that weren't yours to control.

Never here. Never now. Always scattered across yesterday and tomorrow.

The cost of that was crushing. You were exhausted from carrying regrets that belonged to yesterday and borrowing worries from tomorrow. Your today was weighed down by burdens it was never meant to carry.

But somewhere along the journey—through the swamp and the water's edge, through learning rhythms and sending roots deep, through seeing your story in God's story and trusting nothing is wasted—you started to discover something revolutionary:

This moment is enough.

Not because it's perfect. Not because all your questions are answered or your problems are solved.

But because God's name is "I AM"—present tense—and His grace meets you here, now, in this breath, in this step, in this exact moment you're living.

You don't need tomorrow's grace today. You can't access yesterday's moments anymore. All you have—all you've ever had—is this moment.

And when you stop running from it and start receiving it as the gift it is, you discover something remarkable:

It's enough.

You take a sip of coffee, fully tasting it. And you whisper, "This moment is enough."

**The Geography of Presence (2 pages):**

Most of us live everywhere except the present moment.

We replay yesterday's conversations, regretting what we said or didn't say. We rehearse tomorrow's scenarios, anxious about what might happen or what we'll need. We carry the weight of past mistakes into today and borrow future worries to make today even heavier.

But we're rarely here. Fully present. Fully alive to this moment.

And we wonder why we're exhausted. Why anxiety feels constant. Why life feels like it's always somewhere else—either behind us in regret or ahead of us in fear.

Living in the present feels like:
- **Breath.** Deep, full, unforced. Not gasping for what's gone or hyperventilating about what's coming.
- **Attention.** Actually listening to the person in front of you instead of mentally rehearsing your response.
- **Gratitude.** Noticing what's here instead of obsessing over what's missing.
- **Rest.** Not from activity, but in activity. Working from presence instead of from anxiety.
- **Trust.** Believing that today's grace is sufficient for today. And tomorrow's will come tomorrow.

But here's what living in the present might also feel like, at least at first:
- **Discomfort.** Because the present requires you to feel what you've been avoiding.
- **Boredom.** Because you're so used to constant stimulation and distraction.
- **Vulnerability.** Because being here means acknowledging what's actually true right now.
- **Fear.** Because if you're not planning for tomorrow or fixing yesterday, what if everything falls apart?

This is normal. Because presence challenges everything our culture teaches us about productivity, control, and security.

Our culture says: Plan everything. Control outcomes. Never slow down.

Grace says: Be here now. Trust God with outcomes. Rest is not weakness.

Presence is a practice. A discipline. A choice you make moment by moment to come back here, to this breath, to this moment, to this sufficient grace.

**Key Themes (3-4 pages):**

**1. God's Name is "I AM" – Present Tense**

When Moses asked God for His name, God didn't say "I was" or "I will be." He said:

> "I AM WHO I AM. This is what you are to say to the Israelites: I AM has sent me to you."
>
> — Exodus 3:14

Present tense. Always.

God isn't just the God of your past—though He was faithful there. He isn't just the God of your future—though He'll be faithful there too.

He is the God of your present. Here. Now. In this moment.

This changes everything. Because if God is present-tense, then His grace is present-tense too. Not stored up from yesterday. Not held back until tomorrow. Here. Now. Sufficient for this moment.

Paul writes: "My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness" (2 Corinthians 12:9).

Sufficient. Not abundant for tomorrow. Not excess for next week. Sufficient for today. For this moment. For this need.

That's all you need. And it's enough.

I spent years trying to secure tomorrow's grace today. Planning obsessively. Preparing for every contingency. Trying to control outcomes that weren't mine to control.

And I was exhausted. Anxious. Never present.

But when I learned to trust that God's grace is sufficient for this moment—and that tomorrow's grace will come tomorrow—I began to rest.

Not the rest of inactivity. The rest of presence. Being here. Trusting now.

**2. Matthew 6:34 – Today's Troubles Are Sufficient**

Jesus addresses our tendency to borrow tomorrow's worries:

> "Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own."
>
> — Matthew 6:34

This isn't fatalism. It's wisdom.

Jesus isn't saying troubles won't come. He's saying don't add tomorrow's troubles to today's load.

Today has enough to carry. Don't make it heavier by adding what hasn't happened yet.

I'm a worrier by nature. My mind races to worst-case scenarios. What if this happens? What if that fails? What if everything falls apart?

And Jesus says: Stop. Come back to today. Today has enough. You don't need to carry tomorrow too.

This is freedom. Real freedom. The freedom to engage fully with what's right in front of you instead of being paralyzed by what might come.

Living in the moment doesn't mean being oblivious to the future. It means trusting that God will give you what you need when you need it. That tomorrow's grace will come tomorrow. That today's grace is sufficient for today.

**3. The Manna Experience: Daily Bread**

When Israel wandered in the wilderness, God provided manna every morning. Daily bread. But the instruction was clear: gather only what you need for today. Don't try to hoard tomorrow's provision.

Those who tried to keep extra found it rotting by morning. The lesson: trust today's provision for today. Tomorrow will have its own.

This is living in the moment. Not grasping for more than you need. Not anxiously securing tomorrow. Just receiving today's grace and trusting tomorrow's will come.

> "Give us this day our daily bread."
>
> — Matthew 6:11

Not weekly bread. Not monthly bread. Daily bread.

Because grace is meant to be received in rhythm—morning by morning, day by day, moment by moment.

**4. Mary and Martha: The Better Choice**

The story of Mary and Martha (Luke 10:38-42) perfectly captures the tension between doing and being, between productivity and presence.

Martha is distracted by preparations—good things, necessary things. But she's missing the moment. Missing the presence of Jesus right there in her home.

Mary, on the other hand, sits at Jesus' feet. Present. Attentive. Fully engaged in the moment.

Jesus' words to Martha are gentle but clear:

> "Martha, Martha, you are worried and upset about many things, but few things are needed—or indeed only one. Mary has chosen what is better, and it will not be taken away from her."
>
> — Luke 10:41-42

The better choice: presence over productivity. Being over doing. This moment with Jesus over the endless list of tasks.

This doesn't mean tasks don't matter. It means they're not the ultimate thing.

The ultimate thing is being present to God's presence. Being attentive to this moment. Being fully here.

I've been Martha most of my life. Busy. Productive. Distracted by preparations. Always doing.

And I've missed moments. Beautiful, sacred, unrepeatable moments because I was too busy to be present.

I'm learning—slowly—to choose Mary's part. To sit. To be. To let the tasks wait while I'm fully present to what matters most.

**5. Practices of Presence**

Living in the moment isn't automatic. It's a practice. A discipline. A set of habits that train you to be present.

Here are some practices that help:

**Breath prayers.** Simple prayers that sync with your breathing. "Lord Jesus Christ / have mercy on me" or "Be still / and know." They bring you back to this breath, this moment.

**Daily examen.** Reviewing your day with God at the end of each day. Noticing where you experienced His presence. Where you were grateful. Where you struggled. This trains your attention to see God in ordinary moments.

**Sabbath rest.** A weekly practice of stopping, resting, and simply being. Teaching yourself that your worth isn't tied to your productivity.

**Mindful activities.** Walking without a podcast in your ears. Eating without scrolling your phone. Having a conversation without planning your response. Fully engaging with what you're doing.

**Gratitude practice.** Pausing to notice what's here instead of what's missing. Giving thanks for this moment, this breath, this grace.

These aren't magic. They're training. Teaching yourself to notice God's presence in this moment. Anchoring yourself in the here and now.

**6. Fixing Your Eyes on Jesus**

Hebrews 12:1-2: "Let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us, fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of faith."

The race is now. The moment is here. Fix your eyes.

Not wandering eyes that constantly look around at what others have or what might go wrong.

Not backward eyes that live in regret.

Not anxious eyes that strain to see the distant future.

Fixed eyes. On Jesus. On this moment. On the grace that's present right now.

Fixing your eyes isn't passive. It's an active discipline. A choice you make moment by moment.

Choosing to see this moment—not as a means to an end, but as the place where God is present.

Choosing to focus on what you can control—your response, your attitude, your obedience—and release what you can't.

Choosing to look at Jesus instead of at the waves. At truth instead of at fear. At grace instead of at guilt.

**Biblical Parallels (2-3 pages):**

**Adam and Eve in the Garden (Genesis 1-3)**

In the beginning, God created humans and placed them in a garden. Not a palace. Not a temple. A garden—a place of simple, present-moment living.

God walked with them in the garden in the cool of the day. Presence. Relationship. This-moment living.

The fall wasn't just about disobedience. It was about reaching for something beyond the moment—grasping for knowledge, for autonomy, for tomorrow's wisdom today.

The story of redemption is, in many ways, God bringing us back to the garden. Back to simple presence. Back to walking with Him in this moment.

**The Exodus and Daily Manna (Exodus 16)**

When Israel wandered in the wilderness, God provided manna each morning. Daily bread. But the instruction was clear: gather only what you need for today.

Those who tried to hoard manna for tomorrow found it rotting by morning. The lesson: trust today's provision for today. Tomorrow will have its own.

This is living in the moment. Not grasping for more than you need. Not anxiously securing tomorrow. Just receiving today's grace and trusting tomorrow's will come.

**Jesus' Temptation: Present Trust (Matthew 4)**

When Jesus was tempted in the wilderness, the devil tried to pull Him out of the present moment:

"If you are the Son of God, turn these stones to bread" (solve your immediate problem with a shortcut).

"Throw yourself down and angels will save you" (test tomorrow's provision today).

"Bow down and I'll give you all the kingdoms" (take the future now, bypass the process).

Jesus' response every time? Stay in the moment. Trust the Father. Live by what God says today, not by what might happen tomorrow.

This is the pattern: present trust defeats future anxiety. Moment-by-moment obedience overcomes the temptation to control what's next.

**Theological Anchor (2 pages):**

**Hebrews 12:1-2** - "Let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us, fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of faith."

This passage captures the theology of living in the moment.

The race isn't in the past—those miles are behind you. The race isn't in the future—those miles haven't arrived yet. The race is now. This step. This breath. This moment.

And the key to running it well? Fixing your eyes on Jesus.

Not on the finish line so far you can't see it. Not on the starting line you've already left. On Jesus. Who is present. Here. Now.

**Pioneer and perfecter.** Jesus has run this race. He knows the way. And He's with you—not just at the finish, but in this moment.

This is the theological foundation for living in the moment: God is not just the God of your past or your future. He is the God of your present.

The great "I AM"—not "I was" or "I will be," but "I AM." Present tense. Here. Now.

**2 Corinthians 12:9** - "But he said to me, 'My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.'"

Sufficient. Not abundant for tomorrow. Not stored up for next week. Sufficient for today. For this moment. For this need.

That's all you need. And it's enough.

**The Wayfarer Moment (1-2 pages):**

**The shift from living in anxiety to living in the moment changed everything for me.**

For years, I lived in two time zones: yesterday and tomorrow. I carried regrets from the past and anxieties about the future. The only time zone I wasn't living in was the present.

And I was exhausted. Haunted by what I'd done wrong. Terrified of what might go wrong. Never fully present to what was actually happening.

Then I encountered this simple phrase: "This moment is enough."

At first, I didn't believe it. How could this moment be enough? There's so much to fix, so much to plan, so much to worry about.

But slowly, I began to practice presence. Small things at first.

Noticing my breath. Really tasting my food. Looking people in the eye. Listening without already planning my response.

And I discovered something remarkable: when I was fully present, anxiety loosened its grip. When I focused on this moment, the weight of yesterday and tomorrow lifted—at least for a while.

I started asking myself: What does faithfulness look like right now? Not tomorrow. Not in the big picture. Right now.

And the answer was always simpler than I expected. Love this person. Do this task. Trust this truth. Take this next step.

I began practicing what Brother Lawrence called "the practice of the presence of God." Simple prayers throughout the day. Pausing to notice grace. Training my attention to return to this moment, this breath, this opportunity to be present.

I'm still learning. My mind still wanders to yesterday's failures and tomorrow's fears. But more and more, I'm able to return. To this moment. To this breath. To this sufficient grace.

Because this moment really is enough. Not because it's perfect. But because God is present in it.

His grace is here. His love is active. His strength is available.

And that's all I need.

**Song Integration (2-3 pages):**

**Song: "This Moment is Enough"**

**[Verse 1]**
In the garden mercy covered the fall,
Two hearts broken, yet God heard the call.
The waters rose, but His promise remained,
A rainbow whispered through the pouring rain.
Love was alive in the moment back then.

**[Chorus]**
We're not promised tomorrow, only the breath we breathe.
Here in this moment, God's mercy never leaves.
From Genesis to Jesus, the story carries us—
This moment is the promise,
This moment is enough.

**[Verse 2]**
Abraham walked with nothing in hand,
Trusting the covenant, trusting God's plan.
Years went by, but His word held fast,
A future was born from a simple "yes."
Faith is alive in the moment we live.

**[Chorus]**
We're not promised tomorrow, only the breath we breathe.
Here in this moment, God's mercy never leaves.
From Genesis to Jesus, the story carries us—
This moment is the promise,
This moment is enough.

**[Bridge]**
These ancient stories are the ground beneath our feet,
The God of creation still makes our lives complete.
From the garden to the cross, from the grave to today,
The God who redeemed them is redeeming us the same.

**[Verse 3 – Final Verse]**
Joseph was broken, then lifted again,
From prison walls to the palace of men.
What others meant for harm, God turned to grace,
Forgiveness and mercy took sorrow's place.
Redemption is here in the moment we're in.

**[Chorus – Final]**
We're not promised tomorrow, but love is here today.
The God of all beginnings is guiding every step we take.
From Genesis to Jesus, His story carries on—
This moment is the promise,
This moment leads us home.

**[Outro]**
The story isn't over, the story lives in us.
This moment is a gift of grace—
This moment is enough.

This moment is a gift of grace—
This moment is enough.

**The Story Behind the Song:**

For most of my life, I lived anywhere but the present moment.

My mind was either in the past—replaying conversations, regretting decisions, obsessing over what I should have said or done differently—or in the future—worrying about what might happen, catastrophizing outcomes, trying to control variables I couldn't control.

The present? I was rarely there. Because the present required me to feel. To be vulnerable. To acknowledge what was actually true right now instead of what I wished had been or feared might be.

Anxiety was my constant companion. Not the clinical kind that needs medication (though that's valid too). But the low-grade, ever-present anxiety of someone who can't trust God with the moment in front of him.

I was always preparing. Always planning. Always trying to get ahead of the next crisis.

And I was exhausted.

The wake-up call came during a season of transition. Everything felt uncertain. My future was unclear. My past was full of regret. And the present? The present was terrifying because I couldn't control it.

A friend asked me: "What do you need right now? Not tomorrow. Not next month. Right now."

And I couldn't answer. Because I didn't know. I'd spent so long living in yesterday and tomorrow that I'd forgotten how to be present to today.

"Maybe the question you need to ask isn't 'What's going to happen?' but 'Is God's grace enough for this moment?'"

And I wanted to say yes. But honestly? I didn't know if I believed it.

That's when I started studying how God met people in their present moments throughout Scripture.

Adam and Eve weren't given tomorrow's grace. They were given the garden that day.

Abraham wasn't promised the full picture. He was called to trust God in that moment of promise.

Joseph wasn't told the palace was coming. He was called to remain faithful in the prison.

The pattern was clear: God's people have always been called to live in the present tense. To trust that God's grace today is sufficient.

The song emerged from this study. I wanted to trace redemption history through the lens of present-moment faithfulness.

The garden. The flood. Abraham's yes. Joseph's redemption. All the way to Jesus.

And the refrain: "We're not promised tomorrow, only the breath we breathe. Here in this moment, God's mercy never leaves."

This isn't resignation. It's liberation.

I'm not promised tomorrow. I don't need tomorrow's grace today. I just need this breath. This moment. This sufficient grace right here.

And when you live from that truth—when you really believe this moment is enough—anxiety loses its grip.

You're free to be fully present. Fully here. Fully alive to the grace that's already present.

**Reflections for the Road (1-2 pages):**

**Questions for the Journey:**
- Where do you spend most of your mental energy—past, present, or future? Be honest.
- What does "fixing your eyes on Jesus" look like practically for you today? Write it down. Be specific.
- Read Genesis 1:27 and Matthew 6:34 slowly. What is God saying to you about living in the present?
- What practice of presence could you begin today? Breath prayers? Gratitude journaling? Sabbath rest? Pick one.

**Practice: The Daily Examen**

One of the most powerful practices for cultivating present-moment awareness is the Daily Examen. Here's a simple version:

**1. Become aware of God's presence**
Take a few deep breaths. Acknowledge that God is present with you right now. Thank Him for this moment.

**2. Review the day with gratitude**
Walk through your day from start to finish. Notice where you saw God's presence. Where you experienced grace. What brought joy, peace, or connection.

**3. Pay attention to your emotions**
What moments stirred strong emotions—joy, anger, peace, anxiety? Don't judge them. Just notice them. These are often clues to where God is at work.

**4. Choose one feature of the day**
Pick one moment that stands out. Sit with it. What was God doing in that moment? What was He inviting you to?

**5. Look toward tomorrow**
Not with anxiety, but with hope. What's one thing you're facing tomorrow? How do you want to respond? What grace do you need? Ask God for that grace. And trust that when tomorrow becomes today, the grace will be there.

---

**Closing Image:**

You're standing at the edge of tomorrow, but you're not stepping into it yet. Not because you're afraid. But because you're learning the sacred art of being here. Now. In this moment.

The sun is setting on today. Tomorrow is still dark, still unknown. But this moment—this space between what was and what will be—is filled with light.

You can feel it. God's presence. Not in yesterday's memory. Not in tomorrow's promise. Here. Now. In this breath.

You remember the journey. The swamp. The water's edge. The unforced rhythms. The deep roots. The redemption story. The promise that nothing is wasted. The truth that the devil is on the run.

All of it leading here. To this moment.

And you understand: every moment of the journey was preparation for this. For learning to be present. To trust. To receive this moment—just as it is—as enough.

Tomorrow will come. It always does. And when it arrives, it will bring its own grace, its own challenges, its own moments.

But you don't need tomorrow's grace today. You just need this moment's grace. And it's here. Sufficient. Complete. Enough.

You whisper the prayer that's become your anthem: "This moment is a gift of grace. This moment is enough."

And you mean it. Because you've learned the secret: God is the great I AM. Not I was. Not I will be. I AM.

Present tense. Here. Now. In this moment.

You take a breath—deep, full, grateful. And you step forward. Not into tomorrow. Into this moment. The only moment that's actually yours.

And in this moment, you find everything you need: grace for this breath, strength for this step, love for this person, wisdom for this choice.

This moment is enough.

Not because it's perfect. But because God is in it.

And God is always enough.

The journey continues. There are miles ahead. But you're not walking them yet. You're walking this step. Living this breath. Trusting this moment.

And this moment—this sacred, grace-filled, God-inhabited moment—is enough.

More than enough.

It's everything.
