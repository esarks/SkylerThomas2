**An Invitation to Be Here**

You've journeyed through thirteen chapters. From swamp to water's edge. From crisis to rhythm. From scattered to rooted. From waste to redemption. From defeat to victory.

But now I need to ask you one final question:

**Where are you right now?**

Not physically. Mentally. Emotionally. Spiritually.

Are you here? Or are you replaying yesterday's conversations you wish you'd handled differently? Rehearsing tomorrow's scenarios that might never happen? Catastrophizing outcomes that probably won't come to pass?

Be honest. Most of us live everywhere except the present moment.

We're stuck in the past, replaying and regretting. Or anxious about the future, planning and preparing and trying to control outcomes that aren't ours to control.

Never here. Never now. Always scattered across yesterday and tomorrow.

The cost of that is crushing. You're exhausted from carrying regrets that belong to yesterday and borrowing worries from tomorrow. Your today is weighed down by burdens it was never meant to carry.

But here's what I've discovered, and it's the truth that brings rest:

**This moment is enough.**

Not because it's perfect. Not because all your questions are answered or your problems are solved.

But because God's name is "I AM"—present tense—and His grace meets you here, now, in this breath, in this step, in this exact moment you're living.

This final chapter is about learning to be present. To live here, now, instead of scattered across time. To fix your eyes on what's Real instead of on what was or what might be.

To trust that this moment, with sufficient grace, is enough.

You don't need tomorrow's grace today. You can't access yesterday's moments anymore. All you have—all you've ever had—is this moment.

And when you stop running from it and start receiving it as the gift it is, you discover something remarkable:

It's enough.

So before you continue—this final time—pause. Actually pause. Be here. Consider:

*Can you say, even if it feels strange: "God, I'm here. Right now. Not yesterday, not tomorrow. Here. This moment is enough. Your grace meets me here. Help me stay present. Help me be here with You."*

That's the prayer that opens presence.

Because what comes next isn't about doing more. It's about being here—fully, completely, presently here—where grace has always been waiting.

---

Most of us live everywhere except the present moment.

We replay yesterday's conversations, regretting what we said or didn't say. We rehearse tomorrow's scenarios, anxious about what might happen or what we'll need. We carry the weight of past mistakes into today and borrow future worries to make today even heavier.

But we're rarely here. Fully present. Fully alive to this moment.

And we wonder why we're exhausted. Why anxiety feels constant. Why life feels like it's always somewhere else—either behind us in regret or ahead of us in fear.

Living in the present feels like:
- **Breath.** Deep, full, unforced. Not gasping for what's gone or hyperventilating about what's coming.
- **Attention.** Actually listening to the person in front of you instead of mentally rehearsing your response.
- **Gratitude.** Noticing what's here instead of obsessing over what's missing.
- **Rest.** Not from activity, but in activity. Working from presence instead of from anxiety.
- **Trust.** Believing that today's grace is sufficient for today. And tomorrow's will come tomorrow.

But here's what living in the present might also feel like, at least at first:
- **Discomfort.** Because the present requires you to feel what you've been avoiding.
- **Boredom.** Because you're so used to constant stimulation and distraction.
- **Vulnerability.** Because being here means acknowledging what's actually true right now.
- **Fear.** Because if you're not planning for tomorrow or fixing yesterday, what if everything falls apart?

This is normal. Because presence challenges everything our culture teaches us about productivity, control, and security.

Our culture says: Plan everything. Control outcomes. Never slow down.

Grace says: Be here now. Trust God with outcomes. Rest is not weakness.

Presence is a practice. A discipline. A choice you make moment by moment to come back here, to this breath, to this moment, to this sufficient grace.

## Key Themes

### 1. God's Name is "I AM" – Present Tense

When Moses asked God for His name, God didn't say "I was" or "I will be." He said:

> "I AM WHO I AM. This is what you are to say to the Israelites: I AM has sent me to you."
>
> — Exodus 3:14

Present tense. Always.

God isn't just the God of your past—though He was faithful there. He isn't just the God of your future—though He'll be faithful there too.

He is the God of your present. Here. Now. In this moment.

This changes everything. Because if God is present-tense, then His grace is present-tense too. Not stored up from yesterday. Not held back until tomorrow. Here. Now. Sufficient for this moment.

Paul writes: "My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness" (2 Corinthians 12:9).

Sufficient. Not abundant for tomorrow. Not excess for next week. Sufficient for today. For this moment. For this need.

That's all you need. And it's enough.

I spent years trying to secure tomorrow's grace today. Planning obsessively. Preparing for every contingency. Trying to control outcomes that weren't mine to control.

And I was exhausted. Anxious. Never present.

But when I learned to trust that God's grace is sufficient for this moment—and that tomorrow's grace will come tomorrow—I began to rest.

Not the rest of inactivity. The rest of presence. Being here. Trusting now.

### 2. Matthew 6:34 – Today's Troubles Are Sufficient

Jesus addresses our tendency to borrow tomorrow's worries:

> "Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own."
>
> — Matthew 6:34

This isn't fatalism. It's wisdom.

Jesus isn't saying troubles won't come. He's saying don't add tomorrow's troubles to today's load.

Today has enough to carry. Don't make it heavier by adding what hasn't happened yet.

I'm a worrier by nature. My mind races to worst-case scenarios. What if this happens? What if that fails? What if everything falls apart?

And Jesus says: Stop. Come back to today. Today has enough. You don't need to carry tomorrow too.

This is freedom. Real freedom. The freedom to engage fully with what's right in front of you instead of being paralyzed by what might come.

Living in the moment doesn't mean being oblivious to the future. It means trusting that God will give you what you need when you need it. That tomorrow's grace will come tomorrow. That today's grace is sufficient for today.

Corrie ten Boom, who lived through the horrors of a Nazi concentration camp, learned this truth:

> "Worry does not empty tomorrow of its sorrow. It empties today of its strength."
>
> — Corrie ten Boom, *Clippings from My Notebook*

If anyone had reason to worry about tomorrow, it was Corrie. But she discovered that borrowing tomorrow's troubles only robs today of the grace needed to live it well.

### 3. The Manna Experience: Daily Bread

When Israel wandered in the wilderness, God provided manna every morning. Daily bread. But the instruction was clear: gather only what you need for today. Don't try to hoard tomorrow's provision.

Those who tried to keep extra found it rotting by morning. The lesson: trust today's provision for today. Tomorrow will have its own.

This is living in the moment. Not grasping for more than you need. Not anxiously securing tomorrow. Just receiving today's grace and trusting tomorrow's will come.

> "Give us this day our daily bread."
>
> — Matthew 6:11

Not weekly bread. Not monthly bread. Daily bread.

Because grace is meant to be received in rhythm—morning by morning, day by day, moment by moment.

### 4. Mary and Martha: The Better Choice

The story of Mary and Martha (Luke 10:38-42) perfectly captures the tension between doing and being, between productivity and presence.

Martha is distracted by preparations—good things, necessary things. But she's missing the moment. Missing the presence of Jesus right there in her home.

Mary, on the other hand, sits at Jesus' feet. Present. Attentive. Fully engaged in the moment.

Jesus' words to Martha are gentle but clear:

> "Martha, Martha, you are worried and upset about many things, but few things are needed—or indeed only one. Mary has chosen what is better, and it will not be taken away from her."
>
> — Luke 10:41-42

The better choice: presence over productivity. Being over doing. This moment with Jesus over the endless list of tasks.

This doesn't mean tasks don't matter. It means they're not the ultimate thing.

The ultimate thing is being present to God's presence. Being attentive to this moment. Being fully here.

I've been Martha most of my life. Busy. Productive. Distracted by preparations. Always doing.

And I've missed moments. Beautiful, sacred, unrepeatable moments because I was too busy to be present.

I'm learning—slowly—to choose Mary's part. To sit. To be. To let the tasks wait while I'm fully present to what matters most.

### 5. Practices of Presence

Living in the moment isn't automatic. It's a practice. A discipline. A set of habits that train you to be present.

Here are some practices that help:

**Breath prayers.** Simple prayers that sync with your breathing. "Lord Jesus Christ / have mercy on me" or "Be still / and know." They bring you back to this breath, this moment.

**Daily examen.** Reviewing your day with God at the end of each day. Noticing where you experienced His presence. Where you were grateful. Where you struggled. This trains your attention to see God in ordinary moments.

**Sabbath rest.** A weekly practice of stopping, resting, and simply being. Teaching yourself that your worth isn't tied to your productivity.

**Mindful activities.** Walking without a podcast in your ears. Eating without scrolling your phone. Having a conversation without planning your response. Fully engaging with what you're doing.

**Gratitude practice.** Pausing to notice what's here instead of what's missing. Giving thanks for this moment, this breath, this grace.

These aren't magic. They're training. Teaching yourself to notice God's presence in this moment. Anchoring yourself in the here and now.

### 6. Fixing Your Eyes on Jesus

Hebrews 12:1-2: "Let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us, fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of faith."

The race is now. The moment is here. Fix your eyes.

Not wandering eyes that constantly look around at what others have or what might go wrong.

Not backward eyes that live in regret.

Not anxious eyes that strain to see the distant future.

Fixed eyes. On Jesus. On this moment. On the grace that's present right now.

Fixing your eyes isn't passive. It's an active discipline. A choice you make moment by moment.

Choosing to see this moment—not as a means to an end, but as the place where God is present.

Choosing to focus on what you can control—your response, your attitude, your obedience—and release what you can't.

Choosing to look at Jesus instead of at the waves. At truth instead of at fear. At grace instead of at guilt.

## Stories of Presence

**Adam and Eve in the Garden (Genesis 1-3)**

In the beginning, God created humans and placed them in a garden. Not a palace with protocol and hierarchy. Not a temple with rituals and rules. A garden—soil under their feet, fruit on the trees, animals to name, work to do with their hands. Simple. Present. Alive.

Picture the scene: evening comes, the heat of the day fading. A breeze moves through the trees. And they hear the sound of the LORD God walking in the garden. Not a distant voice from heaven. Not a vision or a dream. Walking. Present. With them.

This is what humanity was made for: present-moment communion with God. No anxiety about tomorrow. No regret about yesterday. Just now. This moment. This conversation. This walk together.

But the serpent's temptation was all about pulling them out of the present. "You will be like God, knowing good and evil." Not today. Tomorrow. Not what you have. What you could have. Not contentment in this moment. Grasping for something more.

Eve looked at the fruit—pleasing to the eye, desirable for gaining wisdom—and she reached beyond the present moment. Reached for tomorrow's wisdom today. Reached for knowledge God hadn't given yet. Reached beyond simple trust.

And everything broke. Not just in that moment. In every moment after.

The story of redemption is, in many ways, God bringing us back to the garden. Back to simple presence. Back to walking with Him in the cool of the day. Back to this-moment trust instead of tomorrow's anxiety.

**The Exodus and Daily Manna (Exodus 16)**

Every morning in the wilderness, the Israelites would wake to find the ground covered with something they'd never seen before. Thin flakes, white like coriander seed, appearing with the dew. They called it "manna"—literally, "What is it?"

The routine became sacred: rise early, before the sun gets too hot. Walk out of your tent with a container. Bend down. Gather. Enough for your family for today. Just today.

God's instruction was explicit: "Each one is to gather as much as they need. Take an omer for each person you have in your tent." Not more. Not less. Just enough.

Some people didn't trust it. They gathered extra, hoarding manna for tomorrow just in case God didn't show up again. But the next morning, they'd open their containers to find worms crawling through yesterday's provision. It stank. Rotted. Useless.

The only exception was the day before Sabbath—then they could gather a double portion, and it would keep. Because God wanted them to rest, to trust that His provision covered even the day they didn't work.

The lesson repeated six days a week for forty years: trust today's provision for today. Tomorrow will have manna of its own. You don't need to secure it now. You don't need to hoard grace.

This is living in the moment. Not grasping for more than you need. Not anxiously securing tomorrow at the expense of today's trust. Just receiving today's grace with open hands, knowing tomorrow's grace will be there when you need it.

**Jesus' Temptation: Present Trust (Matthew 4)**

In Chapter 13, we explored Jesus' wilderness temptation as a model for spiritual warfare—how He resisted the devil's attacks by standing on Scripture. But there's another dimension to this story that reveals the heart of present-moment living.

Each of the devil's three temptations was an invitation to abandon the present moment:

**First temptation**: "Turn these stones to bread." In other words: Escape this moment's discomfort. Why trust the Father's provision when you can solve it yourself right now?

**Second temptation**: "Throw yourself down and angels will save you." In other words: Force tomorrow's provision into today. Make God prove He'll be faithful in the future by manufacturing a crisis now.

**Third temptation**: "Bow down and I'll give you all the kingdoms." In other words: Skip the process. Take the future today. Bypass the cross and grab the crown right now.

Every temptation pulled Jesus out of present trust—toward immediate relief, manufactured proof, or future shortcuts.

And every response anchored Jesus back in the present: "Man shall not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the mouth of God." The Father's word for *this moment* was: fast, trust, wait. So Jesus stayed present to that word.

This is the pattern for living in the moment: present trust defeats future anxiety. Moment-by-moment obedience overcomes the temptation to escape discomfort or control what's next. Jesus didn't grasp for tomorrow's grace today—He trusted that this moment's grace was sufficient.

## The Core Scripture Truth

**Hebrews 12:1-2** - "Let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us, fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of faith."

This passage captures the theology of living in the moment.

The race isn't in the past—those miles are behind you. The race isn't in the future—those miles haven't arrived yet. The race is now. This step. This breath. This moment.

And the key to running it well? Fixing your eyes on Jesus.

Not on the finish line so far you can't see it. Not on the starting line you've already left. On Jesus. Who is present. Here. Now.

**Pioneer and perfecter.** Jesus has run this race. He knows the way. And He's with you—not just at the finish, but in this moment.

This is the theological foundation for living in the moment: God is not just the God of your past or your future. He is the God of your present.

The great "I AM"—not "I was" or "I will be," but "I AM." Present tense. Here. Now.

> "But he said to me, 'My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.'"
>
> — 2 Corinthians 12:9

Sufficient. Not abundant for tomorrow. Not stored up for next week. Sufficient for today. For this moment. For this need.

That's all you need. And it's enough.

## The Wayfarer Moment

The shift from living in anxiety to living in the moment changed everything for me.

For years, I lived in two time zones: yesterday and tomorrow. I carried regrets from the past and anxieties about the future. The only time zone I wasn't living in was the present.

And I was exhausted. Haunted by what I'd done wrong. Terrified of what might go wrong. Never fully present to what was actually happening.

Then I encountered this simple phrase: "This moment is enough."

At first, I didn't believe it. How could this moment be enough? There's so much to fix, so much to plan, so much to worry about.

But slowly, I began to practice presence. Small things at first.

Noticing my breath. Really tasting my food. Looking people in the eye. Listening without already planning my response.

And I discovered something remarkable: when I was fully present, anxiety loosened its grip. When I focused on this moment, the weight of yesterday and tomorrow lifted—at least for a while.

I started asking myself: What does faithfulness look like right now? Not tomorrow. Not in the big picture. Right now.

And the answer was always simpler than I expected. Love this person. Do this task. Trust this truth. Take this next step.

I began practicing what Brother Lawrence called "the practice of the presence of God." Simple prayers throughout the day. Pausing to notice grace. Training my attention to return to this moment, this breath, this opportunity to be present.

I'm still learning. My mind still wanders to yesterday's failures and tomorrow's fears. But more and more, I'm able to return. To this moment. To this breath. To this sufficient grace.

Because this moment really is enough. Not because it's perfect. But because God is present in it.

His grace is here. His love is active. His strength is available.

And that's all I need.

---
## Song Integration

I'd spent most of my life living anywhere but the present moment. My mind was either in the past—replaying conversations, regretting decisions, obsessing over what I should have said—or in the future—catastrophizing outcomes, trying to control variables I couldn't control. The present? I was rarely there. Because the present required me to feel, to be vulnerable, to acknowledge what was actually true right now.

Anxiety was my constant companion. The low-grade, ever-present anxiety of someone who can't trust God with the moment in front of him. I was always preparing, always planning, always trying to get ahead of the next crisis. And I was exhausted.

During a season of transition, when everything felt uncertain, a friend asked: "What do you need right now? Not tomorrow. Right now."

I couldn't answer. I'd spent so long living in yesterday and tomorrow that I'd forgotten how to be present to today.

"Maybe the question you need to ask isn't 'What's going to happen?' but 'Is God's grace enough for this moment?'"

I wanted to say yes. But honestly? I didn't know if I believed it.

That's when I began studying how God met people in their present moments throughout Scripture. Adam and Eve weren't given tomorrow's grace—they were given the garden that day. Abraham wasn't promised the full picture—he was called to trust God in that moment of promise. Joseph wasn't told the palace was coming—he was called to remain faithful in the prison.

The pattern was clear: God's people have always been called to live in the present tense. To trust that today's grace is sufficient for today.

"This Moment is Enough" emerged from this study. I wanted to trace redemption history through the lens of present-moment faithfulness—from the garden through the flood, Abraham's yes, Joseph's redemption, all the way to Jesus. And the refrain became my anthem: "We're not promised tomorrow, only the breath we breathe. Here in this moment, God's mercy never leaves."

This isn't resignation. It's liberation. I'm not promised tomorrow. I don't need tomorrow's grace today. I just need this breath, this moment, this sufficient grace right here. When you live from that truth—when you really believe this moment is enough—anxiety loses its grip. You're free to be fully present, fully here, fully alive to the grace that's already present.

## Lyrics: This Moment is Enough

**[Verse 1]**
In the garden mercy covered the fall,
Two hearts broken, yet God heard the call.
The waters rose, but His promise remained,
A rainbow whispered through the pouring rain.
Love was alive in the moment back then.

**[Chorus]**
We're not promised tomorrow, only the breath we breathe.
Here in this moment, God's mercy never leaves.
From Genesis to Jesus, the story carries us—
This moment is the promise,
This moment is enough.

**[Verse 2]**
Abraham walked with nothing in hand,
Trusting the covenant, trusting God's plan.
Years went by, but His word held fast,
A future was born from a simple "yes."
Faith is alive in the moment we live.

**[Chorus]**
We're not promised tomorrow, only the breath we breathe.
Here in this moment, God's mercy never leaves.
From Genesis to Jesus, the story carries us—
This moment is the promise,
This moment is enough.

**[Bridge]**
These ancient stories are the ground beneath our feet,
The God of creation still makes our lives complete.
From the garden to the cross, from the grave to today,
The God who redeemed them is redeeming us the same.

**[Verse 3 – Final Verse]**
The prophets proclaimed what the Father would do,
Messiah would come, make all things new.
From Isaiah's promise to shepherds' surprise,
The Word became flesh before human eyes.
Love took on skin in the moment Divine.

**[Chorus – Final]**
We're not promised tomorrow, but love is here today.
The God of all beginnings is guiding every step we take.
From Genesis to Jesus, His story carries on—
This moment is the promise,
This moment leads us home.

**[Outro]**
The story isn't over, the story lives in us.
This moment is a gift of grace—
This moment is enough.

This moment is a gift of grace—
This moment is enough.

## Key Takeaways

- **God's name is "I AM"—present tense, not past or future.** He meets you in this moment, not in yesterday's regrets or tomorrow's anxieties. This moment is where His presence and grace are available.
- **Sufficient grace for today is enough.** Like manna in the wilderness, God's grace is given daily. Don't hoard yesterday's grace or borrow tomorrow's worry—receive what's here, now.
- **Presence over productivity.** Mary chose the better part—sitting at Jesus' feet—while Martha stressed over serving. Being with God matters more than doing for God.
- **Fix your eyes on Jesus, not the waves.** Hebrews 12:2 urges you to focus on Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith. When you look at circumstances, you sink. When you look at Him, you walk on water.

## Reflections for the Road

**Questions for the Journey:**

1. **Where do you spend most of your mental energy—past, present, or future?**
   Be honest. Are you replaying yesterday's conversations? Rehearsing tomorrow's scenarios? Catastrophizing outcomes that may never happen? Notice where your mind goes when it wanders. Write it down.
   What is one specific thing you're carrying from yesterday or borrowing from tomorrow that's weighing down your today?

2. **Read Exodus 3:14 and Matthew 6:34 slowly.**
   "I AM WHO I AM" (Exodus 3:14). God's name is present tense. And Jesus says, "Do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own" (Matthew 6:34).
   If God is "I AM" (not "I was" or "I will be"), and tomorrow's grace will come tomorrow, what does that mean for this moment right now? Is this moment enough?

3. **What does "fixing your eyes on Jesus" look like practically for you today?**
   Not wandering eyes that constantly look around at what might go wrong. Not backward eyes living in regret. Not anxious eyes straining to see the distant future. Fixed eyes. On Jesus. On this moment.
   What does that actually look like in your life today? When you notice your mind wandering to past or future, what will you do to bring it back to this moment?

4. **Read Luke 10:38-42 slowly—Mary and Martha.**
   Martha is distracted by preparations. Mary sits at Jesus' feet, present and attentive. Jesus says, "Mary has chosen what is better."
   Where are you being Martha right now? Too busy, too distracted, too productive to be present? What would it look like to choose Mary's part—even for just one moment today?

5. **How will you practice presence this week?**
   Not all the practices. Just one. Breath prayers throughout your day? Daily examen each evening? One tech-free meal where you're fully present? A walk without headphones where you notice what's here?
   Which one practice will you actually do? When will you start? What will you say no to in order to say yes to this practice? Be specific. Make it small. Make it real.

## Practice: The Daily Examen

One of the most powerful practices for cultivating present-moment awareness is the Daily Examen. Here's a simple version:

### 1. Become aware of God's presence
Take a few deep breaths. Acknowledge that God is present with you right now. Thank Him for this moment.

### 2. Review the day with gratitude
Walk through your day from start to finish. Notice where you saw God's presence. Where you experienced grace. What brought joy, peace, or connection.

### 3. Pay attention to your emotions
What moments stirred strong emotions—joy, anger, peace, anxiety? Don't judge them. Just notice them. These are often clues to where God is at work.

### 4. Choose one feature of the day
Pick one moment that stands out. Sit with it. What was God doing in that moment? What was He inviting you to?

### 5. Look toward tomorrow
Not with anxiety, but with hope. What's one thing you're facing tomorrow? How do you want to respond? What grace do you need? Ask God for that grace. And trust that when tomorrow becomes today, the grace will be there.

## Closing Image

You're standing at the edge of tomorrow, but you're not stepping into it yet. Not because you're afraid. But because you're learning the sacred art of being here. Now. In this moment.

The sun is setting on today. Tomorrow is still dark, still unknown. But this moment—this space between what was and what will be—is filled with light.

You can feel it. God's presence. Not in yesterday's memory. Not in tomorrow's promise. Here. Now. In this breath.

You remember the journey. The swamp. The water's edge. The unforced rhythms. The deep roots. The redemption story. The promise that nothing is wasted. The truth that the devil is on the run.

All of it leading here. To this moment.

And you understand: every moment of the journey was preparation for this. For learning to be present. To trust. To receive this moment—just as it is—as enough.

Tomorrow will come. It always does. And when it arrives, it will bring its own grace, its own challenges, its own moments.

But you don't need tomorrow's grace today. You just need this moment's grace. And it's here. Sufficient. Complete. Enough.

You whisper the prayer that's become your anthem: "This moment is a gift of grace. This moment is enough."

And you mean it. Because you've learned the secret: God is the great I AM. Not I was. Not I will be. I AM.

Present tense. Here. Now. In this moment.

You take a breath—deep, full, grateful. And you step forward. Not into tomorrow. Into this moment. The only moment that's actually yours.

And in this moment, you find everything you need: grace for this breath, strength for this step, love for this person, wisdom for this choice.

This moment is enough.

Not because it's perfect. But because God is in it.

And God is always enough.

The journey continues. There are miles ahead. But you're not walking them yet. You're walking this step. Living this breath. Trusting this moment.

And this moment—this sacred, grace-filled, God-inhabited moment—is enough.

More than enough.

It's everything.
