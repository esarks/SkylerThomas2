### Chapter 10: Deep Roots, Strong Growth
**Based on:** "I Will Trust You Lord" (Devotional and Song)

**Opening Scene (2-3 pages):**

It's late July, and the heat wave has been relentless. Three weeks without rain. Your neighbor's lawn is brown and crispy. The flowers in the planters along Main Street are wilting, despite the city's best efforts to keep them watered.

But there's one tree in your yard—an old oak that's been there longer than your house—and it's still green. Lush, even. While everything else withers, this tree stands tall, leaves full and vibrant, like it doesn't even notice the drought.

You mention it to a friend who happens to be a landscaper. "How is that tree still green? Everything else is dying."

He smiles. "Roots. That tree's been there fifty, maybe sixty years. Its roots go down twenty, thirty feet. It's not depending on surface water anymore. It's tapped into something deeper."

You stand there looking at that tree, and something clicks.

This is what you've been missing.

You've learned rhythm. You've discovered the unforced way of living. You're not in crisis mode anymore. But you're also aware—painfully aware—that when stress comes, when pressure mounts, when circumstances get hard, you still revert to old patterns.

You still react defensively when criticized. You still withdraw when hurt. You still carry bitterness longer than you should. You still struggle with pride, with comparison, with the need to prove yourself.

The rhythms are good. But they're not enough. Because rhythms without roots become rote. Practices without depth become performance.

You need more than sustainable patterns. You need deep foundations. The kind that reach down to streams of living water and anchor you when everything else shakes.

You're learning that transformation isn't just about what you do. It's about who you're becoming. And becoming takes time. It happens underground, unseen, in the slow work of roots going deep.

**The Geography of Deep Roots (2 pages):**

Here's the hard truth about roots: you can't see them. You can't measure them. You can't Instagram them.

All the visible growth—the fruit, the leaves, the branches—gets attention. But the roots? They're hidden. Underground. Doing their work in the dark.

This is frustrating for those of us who like to track progress. We want to see results. We want to measure growth. We want before-and-after photos that prove we're changing.

But deep roots don't work that way.

Deep roots look like:
- Choosing to respond instead of react, even when no one's watching
- Forgiving someone who doesn't deserve it and will never know you did
- Staying connected to community when you'd rather withdraw
- Releasing bitterness for the hundredth time because it keeps trying to take root
- Practicing humility in small, daily choices that no one applauds

None of that is impressive. None of that gets likes on social media. None of that makes for a dramatic testimony.

But it's everything. Because roots determine what happens above ground.

When the drought comes—and it will come—surface plants die. They had no depth. No reserves. Nothing to draw from when conditions got hard.

But the deeply rooted? They stay green. Not because they're stronger or trying harder. Because their roots have gone deep enough to reach water others can't access.

The question isn't "What do I look like on the surface?"

The question is "What's happening underground?"

**Key Themes (3-4 pages):**

**1. The Work of Putting to Death**

Before roots can go deep into what belongs, they have to let go of what doesn't. This is the paradox at the heart of spiritual growth: deep roots require dying.

There are things that have to be put to death:

**Pride** - The need to be right. The compulsion to prove ourselves. The addiction to being seen, recognized, validated by others.

Pride keeps roots shallow because it keeps us focused on ourselves rather than God. We're constantly comparing, competing, defending, performing. All that energy goes into image management rather than transformation.

I've spent years defending myself. Explaining myself. Making sure people understood my motives. And all that defending kept me shallow. Because I was more concerned with how I looked than with who I was becoming.

Humility is the antidote. Not self-hatred. But what Paul calls "considering others more significant than yourselves" (Philippians 2:3). The freedom to be wrong and still be loved. To lose the argument and not lose yourself.

**Reactivity** - Responding from wounds instead of from identity. When someone criticizes you, do you react defensively? When life doesn't go your way, do you lash out? When you feel threatened, do you attack?

Reactivity is living from your False Self—the wounded, defended, self-protective version of you.

Deep roots grow when you learn to respond from your True Self—the beloved, secure, grounded-in-God version of you.

I've been working on this for years, and I still fail regularly. Someone questions my decision, and I immediately get defensive. Someone misunderstands my motives, and I rush to explain. Someone hurts me, and I want to hurt back.

But I'm learning. Learning to pause. To feel the reaction without acting on it. To ask: "Is this coming from my woundedness or from my belovedness?"

That pause—that space between stimulus and response—is where deep roots grow.

**Isolation** - The temptation to withdraw when things get hard. To hide your struggles. To pretend you're fine when you're not.

Isolation is the enemy of deep roots. Trees don't grow in isolation—they grow in groves, forests, communities where their roots intertwine with other roots, creating stability and sharing nutrients.

I'm an introvert. When I'm hurting, my instinct is to withdraw. To pull back. To process alone. And sometimes that's healthy. But isolation as a lifestyle? That's deadly.

Deep roots require staying connected even when you want to withdraw. Showing up to community even when you don't feel like it. Being honest about your struggles even when it's scary.

**Bitterness** - The nursing of perceived injustices. The rehearsal of how you've been wronged. The keeping of records. The refusal to forgive.

Bitterness is like poison in the soil. It doesn't hurt the person you're bitter toward—it hurts you. It keeps your roots shallow and twisted, unable to reach the streams of living water because they're too busy clinging to old wounds.

I've carried bitterness. Rehearsed conversations with people who hurt me. Kept score. Built cases. And all that bitterness did was keep me stuck.

Forgiveness is the answer. Not because what happened was okay. But because holding onto it gives it power over you.

You release it so your roots can grow deep into grace rather than staying tangled in grievance.

**2. The Work of Cultivating What Belongs**

Putting to death is only half the work. The other half is cultivating what belongs—the virtues, practices, and postures that create conditions for deep roots.

**Humility** - Acknowledging your need for grace. Admitting you don't have it all together. Embracing your limits rather than pretending they don't exist.

Humility positions you to receive. Pride keeps you on the surface, performing. Humility sends roots deep, receiving.

**Responsiveness** - Acting from your True Self, not your wounded self. Learning to pause between stimulus and response.

This requires self-awareness—knowing your triggers, understanding your patterns, recognizing when you're operating from wounds versus operating from belovedness.

And it requires spiritual practices—silence and solitude to hear God's voice, prayer to seek His guidance, Scripture to renew your mind, community to hold you accountable.

**Connection** - Staying engaged even when vulnerable. Showing up even when it's hard. Choosing relationship over isolation.

I've learned this the hard way: I need people. Not perfect people. Not people who never disappoint me. But people who show up. Who pray for me. Who tell me the truth in love.

Connection is where roots deepen.

**Forgiveness** - Releasing what you can't control. Letting go of the need for justice, vindication, or revenge.

Forgiveness isn't a one-time decision. It's a daily practice. Sometimes an hourly practice. You choose to release the offense again and again until one day you realize it no longer has power over you.

**3. The Tree by Streams of Water**

Psalm 1 paints a picture of flourishing that captures everything deep roots make possible:

> "Blessed is the one who does not walk in step with the wicked... but whose delight is in the law of the LORD, and who meditates on his law day and night. That person is like a tree planted by streams of water, which yields its fruit in season and whose leaf does not wither—whatever they do prospers."
>
> — Psalm 1:1-3

Notice the progression:

**Planted, not drifting.** Intentional, rooted, stable. You've been planted by streams—the water's edge of grace. Now roots are growing deep.

**Streams of water.** The tree doesn't generate its own water. It's positioned by an abundant source. You don't generate your own grace. You're rooted in God's inexhaustible provision.

**Fruit in season.** Not all the time. Not constantly. In season. This is realistic spirituality. There are seasons of growth, seasons of fruit, seasons of dormancy, seasons of pruning. Deep roots don't guarantee constant productivity. They guarantee sustainable fruitfulness over time.

**Leaf does not wither.** Even in drought—hard seasons when surface moisture evaporates, when emotions are dry, when external supports fail—the deeply rooted tree endures. Why? Because deep roots access water others can't reach.

**Whatever they do prospers.** Not prosperity gospel. This is organic flourishing. A well-rooted tree naturally prospers because it's connected to its source.

Stay rooted. The fruit will come. Not forced. Not manufactured. Organic. In season.

**4. Roots Take Time**

Here's what nobody tells you about deep roots: they take time. Years. Sometimes decades.

We live in an instant culture. We want microwavable transformation. Download the app, follow the seven steps, and boom—you're changed.

But roots don't work that way.

A tree doesn't shoot roots thirty feet down in a week. It takes seasons. Storm after storm. Drought after drought. Year after year, the roots slowly, steadily go deeper.

And for most of that time, you can't see the growth. Above ground, the tree might look unchanged. But below ground, everything is happening.

This is the hidden work of transformation. The work that happens when no one's watching. The work that doesn't make for dramatic testimonies because it's slow, steady, mostly invisible.

I'm fifteen years into this journey. And I'm still discovering shallow roots. Still finding places where I react instead of respond. Still uncovering bitterness I thought I'd released. Still learning to stay connected when I want to withdraw.

But I'm also seeing growth I couldn't see five years ago. Situations that would have wrecked me ten years ago now just... don't. Not because I'm stronger. Because the roots have gone deeper. I'm accessing streams I couldn't reach before.

This is the long obedience in the same direction. This is the slow work of becoming.

And it's worth it. Because when the drought comes—and it will come—deep roots mean the difference between withering and thriving.

**Biblical Parallels (2-3 pages):**

**The Parable of the Sower (Matthew 13:1-23)**

Jesus tells a story about a farmer scattering seed. Some falls on the path—birds eat it. Some falls on rocky ground—it sprouts quickly but withers because it has no root. Some falls among thorns that choke it. And some falls on good soil and produces a crop.

The rocky ground is particularly relevant here:

> "The seed falling on rocky ground refers to someone who hears the word and at once receives it with joy. But since they have no root, they last only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, they quickly fall away."
>
> — Matthew 13:20-21

No root. That's the problem. Enthusiasm without depth. Emotion without foundation.

The person receives the Word with joy—there's initial excitement, genuine response. But when heat comes, they wither. Why? No root.

This is the warning: don't settle for surface-level faith. Don't mistake initial enthusiasm for deep transformation. Send roots deep now—through sustained practices, patient trust, consistent rhythms—so when heat comes (and it will), you don't wither.

The good soil represents those who "hear the word, accept it, and produce a crop" (Mark 4:20). But even good soil requires cultivation. Weeding. Watering. Tending.

The disciplines are how you cultivate the soil of your soul so roots can go deep and fruit can come.

**The Vine and the Branches (John 15:1-8)**

Jesus uses agricultural imagery to describe the Christian life:

> "I am the vine; you are the branches. If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing."
>
> — John 15:5

The key word is "remain"—or "abide." This is the language of roots. Branches don't try to produce fruit. They remain connected to the vine. And fruit happens naturally.

You don't manufacture fruit through effort. You remain connected to Jesus through sustained practices of prayer, Scripture, worship, community. And fruit—love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control—grows organically.

But remaining requires intentionality. Branches can be cut off. They can be pruned. They can wither if they don't stay connected to the vine.

The unforced rhythms of grace aren't passive. They're active cooperation with God's life flowing into you. You position yourself. You remain. You abide. And the fruit comes.

**Jeremiah's Promise (Jeremiah 17:7-8)**

The prophet Jeremiah expands on Psalm 1's imagery with even stronger promises:

> "But blessed is the one who trusts in the LORD, whose confidence is in him. They will be like a tree planted by the water that sends out its roots by the stream. It does not fear when heat comes; its leaves are always green. It has no worries in a year of drought and never fails to bear fruit."
>
> — Jeremiah 17:7-8

Notice the difference: Jeremiah emphasizes trust and resilience.

**Trust as the foundation.** Your roots go where your trust is. If you trust yourself, roots stay shallow—limited by your capacity. If you trust God, roots go deep—accessing an infinite source.

**Does not fear when heat comes.** This is the promise: resilience. Heat will come. But deeply rooted trees don't fear it. Not because heat doesn't hurt, but because deep roots access water even when surface conditions are scorching.

**Never fails to bear fruit.** An even stronger promise than Psalm 1's "fruit in season." Why? Because the tree is constantly connected to the stream. It's not dependent on rainfall (external circumstances). It's rooted by a stream (constant internal source).

When you're deeply rooted in God, you don't become fruitless in hard seasons. The fruit might look different—not abundance, but endurance; not productivity, but presence. But you never fail to bear it.

**Theological Anchor (2 pages):**

**John 15:5-8** - "I am the vine; you are the branches. If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing. If you do not remain in me, you are like a branch that is thrown away and withers... This is to my Father's glory, that you bear much fruit, showing yourselves to be my disciples."

This is Jesus's teaching on remaining—on abiding. And it's the theological foundation for everything this chapter teaches about deep roots.

**"I am the vine; you are the branches."**

The relationship is organic, not mechanical. Not master and servant. Vine and branches. Living connection. Shared life. The sap that flows through the vine flows through the branches.

You're not disconnected from Jesus, trying to imitate Him from a distance. You're connected to Jesus, sharing His life.

**"If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit."**

The condition is remaining. Not striving. Not performing. Not white-knuckling your way to holiness. Remaining. Abiding. Staying connected.

And the promise is fruit. Not because you're trying to produce it. But because life is flowing from the vine into the branches. The fruit is inevitable when the connection is sustained.

**"Apart from me you can do nothing."**

This is both humbling and liberating. Humbling because it reminds you: you're not the source. You can't generate spiritual life through your own effort.

Liberating because it takes the pressure off. You don't have to produce. You just have to remain.

**"This is to my Father's glory, that you bear much fruit."**

The goal isn't your glory. It's the Father's. When you bear fruit—when love, joy, peace, patience, kindness grow in you—people see it and give glory to God.

Not because you're amazing. Because God's grace is transforming you.

This is the theological anchor: remain in Jesus. Let His words remain in you. And fruit will come—not forced, but organic. Not manufactured, but received. Not through your effort, but through your abiding.

Deep roots make abiding possible. And abiding makes fruit inevitable.

**The Wayfarer Moment (1-2 pages):**

**Learning to trust the hidden work.**

For years, I equated spiritual growth with visible progress. I wanted to see results. Measure outcomes. Track my advancement.

If I couldn't see it, I questioned whether anything was actually happening.

But roots don't work that way.

The most important growth happens underground. Unseen. Unmeasured. Unremarkable to anyone watching.

Above ground, a tree might look unchanged for months. But below ground, roots are spreading, reaching, deepening. And that hidden work is what makes everything else possible.

I learned this the hard way. After coming out of the swamp, after encountering grace at the water's edge, I wanted instant transformation. I wanted to be different immediately—healed, whole, bearing fruit.

But God was growing roots.

There were days when I felt like nothing was changing. I'd pray and feel nothing. Read Scripture and feel unmoved. Gather with community and still feel alone.

But looking back now, I can see what was happening. Roots were going deep. Not dramatically. Not visibly. But steadily.

Through sustained practices. Through showing up even when I didn't feel like it. Through choosing connection over isolation. Through releasing bitterness and cultivating forgiveness.

The wayfarer moment came when I stopped measuring my progress by what I could see and started trusting the hidden work God was doing.

I stopped asking, "Why aren't I different yet?" and started asking, "Am I remaining in Him? Are my roots going deeper?"

Because here's what I've learned: surface-level change happens fast but doesn't last. Deep transformation happens slowly but endures.

You can manufacture behavior change through willpower. But it won't last. The first time stress hits, you'll revert to old patterns.

But deep roots—roots that reach down to streams of living water—create lasting stability. Not perfection. But resilience. Not arrival. But endurance.

I still have hard days. Days when I'm reactive instead of responsive. Days when I choose isolation over connection. Days when bitterness resurfaces and I have to forgive again.

But I don't panic anymore. Because I know: the roots are there. They're deep. And even when I can't see growth above ground, there's work happening below.

This is the invitation: trust the hidden work. Keep showing up. Keep practicing the disciplines. Keep remaining in Jesus. The fruit will come. In season. When roots are ready.

**The Story Behind the Song:**

I wrote this song during a season when I felt invisible. Not in crisis. Not in the swamp. Just... quietly growing. And wondering if anything was actually changing.

I'd been practicing the rhythms for months. Showing up to prayer even when I didn't feel like it. Reading Scripture even when it felt dry. Staying connected to community even when I wanted to withdraw.

But I couldn't see results. I still struggled with the same issues. Still reacted defensively. Still battled pride. Still felt the pull of isolation.

And I was discouraged. Wondering: Is any of this working? Am I actually growing? Or am I just going through the motions?

Then I read Psalm 1. And Jeremiah 17. And something clicked.

The tree doesn't look dramatically different day to day. But its roots are going deeper. And when drought comes, it doesn't wither. Because the roots have reached water others can't access.

That's when I understood: God wasn't concerned with my visible progress. He was doing the hidden work. Growing roots.

The song poured out as a declaration of trust. Not "I feel strong." But "I will trust You, Lord." Not "I've arrived." But "My roots grow strong."

It became my anthem for the invisible seasons. The times when I couldn't see growth but had to trust it was happening. When I had to believe that deep roots were forming even though I couldn't measure them.

And looking back now, years later, I can see it. The roots did go deep. The storms came. And I didn't wither.

Not because I'm strong. Because the roots reached living water.

**Reflections for the Road (1-2 pages):**

**Questions for the Journey:**
- What needs to die so roots can go deep? Where is pride keeping you shallow? Where is reactivity preventing growth? Where is isolation cutting you off? Where is bitterness poisoning the soil?
- What practices position you by the stream? Prayer? Scripture? Sabbath? Solitude? Worship? Community? Are you practicing them consistently?
- Where are you trying to manufacture fruit instead of remaining in the vine? Are you striving to be more loving? Trying harder to be joyful? White-knuckling your way to peace?
- What does "fruit in season" mean for you right now? Not every season is fruitful. Some are for growth. Some for pruning. Some for rest. What season are you in?

**Practice: Cultivating Deep Roots**

Here's a simple framework for sending roots deep through spiritual disciplines:

**1. Daily: Drink from the stream**
Choose one practice that connects you to God daily. Morning prayer and Scripture. Lectio divina. Journaling. Listening prayer in silence. The practice matters less than the consistency.

**2. Weekly: Sabbath rest**
Set aside one day (or a few hours) each week for Sabbath. Not as legalism. As gift. Stop striving so you can receive rest. Stop producing so you can receive belovedness.

**3. Monthly: Solitude and silence**
Once a month, create extended space for solitude. A few hours. A half day. A full day if possible. Intentional time alone with God. Away from noise, hurry, screens, people. Listen. Rest. Let God search your heart.

**4. Seasonally: Examine your roots**
Every few months, review: Are my roots going deeper? Or am I staying shallow? Am I more reactive or more responsive? More isolated or more connected? More bitter or more forgiving?

**5. Community: Grow in groves**
Trees don't grow in isolation. Their roots intertwine with other roots. You need community. Real community. Where you can confess struggles, receive prayer, offer encouragement, practice forgiveness, serve together.

**Closing Image:**

You're standing at the base of an ancient tree. Massive. Towering. Its canopy spreads wide, providing shade for acres.

How long has this tree been here? A hundred years? Two hundred? More?

You walk closer and place your hand on the trunk. Solid. Rough. Weathered by countless storms. Scarred by lightning strikes. Marked by seasons of growth and seasons of pruning.

But still standing.

You look up into the branches. Birds nest there. Squirrels scamper. Life thrives in the shelter this tree provides.

And then you look down. At the base. Where roots disappear into the earth.

You can't see them. But you know they're there. Reaching deep. Spreading wide. Anchoring this massive tree so firmly that no storm can topple it.

The roots are why the tree stands.

This is the invitation: send your roots deep. Not for show. Not for applause. Not even for immediate fruit.

For stability. For resilience. For sustainable life.

The work happens underground. In the quiet. In the daily practices. In the sustained rhythms. In the patient trust.

You won't always see results. You won't always feel growth. You won't always sense progress.

But if you remain—if you keep showing up, keep practicing the disciplines, keep choosing connection over isolation, keep releasing bitterness and cultivating forgiveness—the roots will go deep.

And when heat comes, you won't fear. When drought arrives, you won't worry. When storms rage, you won't be uprooted.

Because your roots—hidden, deep, sustained by streams of living water—will hold.

Like a tree planted by streams of water. Leaves green. Fruit in season. Soul strong.

Deeply rooted in the love of God.
