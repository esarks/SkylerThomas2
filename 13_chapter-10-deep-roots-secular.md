**An Invitation to Go Deeper**

You've discovered rhythm. You've learned the unforced way of living. You're not in crisis mode anymore, not frantically trying to maintain impossible intensity.

But now I need to ask you something uncomfortable:

**When stress comes, when pressure mounts, when circumstances get hard—do you still revert to old patterns?**

Be honest. Do you still react defensively when criticized? Still withdraw when hurt? Still carry bitterness longer than you should? Still struggle with pride, with comparison, with the need to prove yourself?

Here's what I've discovered: **Rhythms are good. But rhythms without roots become rote. Practices without depth become performance.**

You need more than sustainable patterns. You need deep foundations. The kind that reach down to streams of living water and anchor you when everything else shakes.

This chapter is about what happens underground. The hidden work. The slow transformation that no one sees but everyone eventually experiences.

It's about discovering that you're not just learning new habits—you're becoming a new person. And becoming takes time. It happens in the dark, unseen, in the patient work of roots going deep.

*Think of a tree during drought. Surface plants die—they had no depth, no reserves, nothing to draw from when conditions got hard. But the deeply rooted? They stay green. Not because they're stronger or trying harder. Because their roots have gone deep enough to reach water others can't access.*

That's what this chapter is about. Not what you look like on the surface. But what's happening underground.

Deep roots require putting to death what doesn't belong: pride, reactivity, isolation, bitterness. And cultivating what does: humility, responsiveness, connection, forgiveness.

None of this is impressive. None of this gets applause. None of this makes for a dramatic testimony.

But it's everything. Because roots determine what happens above ground.

So before you continue, pause. Consider:

*Can you say, even with hesitation: "God, I don't just want to look different. I want to BE different. Do the deep work in me—the underground work, the unseen work. Send my roots down deep until I'm anchored in You, not in circumstances."*

That's the prayer that opens transformation.

Because what comes next isn't about impressive growth. It's about sustainable depth.

---

Here's the hard truth about roots: you can't see them. You can't measure them. You can't Instagram them.

All the visible growth—the fruit, the leaves, the branches—gets attention. But the roots? They're hidden. Underground. Doing their work in the dark.

This is frustrating for those of us who like to track progress. We want to see results. We want to measure growth. We want before-and-after photos that prove we're changing.

But deep roots don't work that way.

Deep roots look like:
- Choosing to respond instead of react, even when no one's watching
- Forgiving someone who doesn't deserve it and will never know you did
- Staying connected to community when you'd rather withdraw
- Releasing bitterness for the hundredth time because it keeps trying to take root
- Practicing humility in small, daily choices that no one applauds

None of that is impressive. None of that gets likes on social media. None of that makes for a dramatic testimony.

But it's everything. Because roots determine what happens above ground.

When the drought comes—and it will come—surface plants die. They had no depth. No reserves. Nothing to draw from when conditions got hard.

But the deeply rooted? They stay green. Not because they're stronger or trying harder. Because their roots have gone deep enough to reach water others can't access.

The question isn't "What do I look like on the surface?"

The question is "What's happening underground?"

## Key Themes

### 1. The Work of Putting to Death

Before roots can go deep into what belongs, they have to let go of what doesn't. This is the paradox at the heart of spiritual growth: deep roots require dying.

There are things that have to be put to death:

**Pride** - The need to be right. The compulsion to prove ourselves. The addiction to being seen, recognized, validated by others.

Pride keeps roots shallow because it keeps us focused on ourselves rather than God. We're constantly comparing, competing, defending, performing. All that energy goes into image management rather than transformation.

I've spent years defending myself. Explaining myself. Making sure people understood my motives. And all that defending kept me shallow. Because I was more concerned with how I looked than with who I was becoming.

Humility is the antidote. Not self-hatred. But what Paul calls "considering others more significant than yourselves" (Philippians 2:3). The freedom to be wrong and still be loved. To lose the argument and not lose yourself.

**Reactivity** - Responding from wounds instead of from identity. When someone criticizes you, do you react defensively? When life doesn't go your way, do you lash out? When you feel threatened, do you attack?

Reactivity is living from your False Self—the wounded, defended, self-protective version of you.

Deep roots grow when you learn to respond from your True Self—the beloved, secure, grounded-in-God version of you.

There's a space between what happens to us and how we respond. In that space lies our power to choose. Viktor Frankl called this the essence of human freedom—the ability to choose our response even in the most difficult circumstances.

I've been working on this for years, and I still fail regularly. Someone questions my decision, and I immediately get defensive. Someone misunderstands my motives, and I rush to explain. Someone hurts me, and I want to hurt back.

But I'm learning. Learning to pause. To feel the reaction without acting on it. To ask: "Is this coming from my woundedness or from my belovedness?"

That pause—that space between stimulus and response—is where deep roots grow.

**Isolation** - The temptation to withdraw when things get hard. To hide your struggles. To pretend you're fine when you're not.

Isolation is the enemy of deep roots. Trees don't grow in isolation—they grow in groves, forests, communities where their roots intertwine with other roots, creating stability and sharing nutrients.

I'm an introvert. When I'm hurting, my instinct is to withdraw. To pull back. To process alone. And sometimes that's healthy. But isolation as a lifestyle? That's deadly.

Deep roots require staying connected even when you want to withdraw. Showing up to community even when you don't feel like it. Being honest about your struggles even when it's scary.

**Bitterness** - The nursing of perceived injustices. The rehearsal of how you've been wronged. The keeping of records. The refusal to forgive.

Bitterness is like poison in the soil. It doesn't hurt the person you're bitter toward—it hurts you. It keeps your roots shallow and twisted, unable to reach the streams of living water because they're too busy clinging to old wounds.

I've carried bitterness. Rehearsed conversations with people who hurt me. Kept score. Built cases. And all that bitterness did was keep me stuck.

Forgiveness is the answer. Not because what happened was okay. But because holding onto it gives it power over you.

You release it so your roots can grow deep into grace rather than staying tangled in grievance.

> "To forgive is to set a prisoner free and discover that the prisoner was you."
> — Lewis B. Smedes, *Forgive and Forget*

Putting things to death is only half the work of sending roots deep. The other half is actively cultivating what belongs—replacing what dies with what brings life.

### 2. The Work of Cultivating What Belongs

Putting to death is only half the work. The other half is cultivating what belongs—the virtues, practices, and postures that create conditions for deep roots.

**Humility** - Acknowledging your need for grace. Admitting you don't have it all together. Embracing your limits rather than pretending they don't exist.

Humility positions you to receive. Pride keeps you on the surface, performing. Humility sends roots deep, receiving.

**Responsiveness** - Acting from your True Self, not your wounded self. Learning to pause between stimulus and response.

This requires self-awareness—knowing your triggers, understanding your patterns, recognizing when you're operating from wounds versus operating from belovedness.

And it requires spiritual practices—silence and solitude to hear God's voice, prayer to seek His guidance, Scripture to renew your mind, community to hold you accountable.

**Connection** - Staying engaged even when vulnerable. Showing up even when it's hard. Choosing relationship over isolation.

I've learned this the hard way: I need people. Not perfect people. Not people who never disappoint me. But people who show up. Who pray for me. Who tell me the truth in love.

Connection is where roots deepen.

**Forgiveness** - Releasing what you can't control. Letting go of the need for justice, vindication, or revenge.

Forgiveness isn't a one-time decision. It's a daily practice. Sometimes an hourly practice. You choose to release the offense again and again until one day you realize it no longer has power over you.

These practices of putting to death and cultivating life create the conditions for deep roots. And Psalm 1 paints the picture of what a deeply rooted life looks like.

### 3. The Tree by Streams of Water

Psalm 1 paints a picture of flourishing that captures everything deep roots make possible:

> "Blessed is the one who does not walk in step with the wicked... but whose delight is in the law of the LORD, and who meditates on his law day and night. That person is like a tree planted by streams of water, which yields its fruit in season and whose leaf does not wither—whatever they do prospers."
>
> — Psalm 1:1-3

Notice the progression:

**Planted, not drifting.** Intentional, rooted, stable. You've been planted by streams—the water's edge of grace. Now roots are growing deep.

**Streams of water.** The tree doesn't generate its own water. It's positioned by an abundant source. You don't generate your own grace. You're rooted in God's inexhaustible provision.

**Fruit in season.** Not all the time. Not constantly. In season. This is realistic spirituality. There are seasons of growth, seasons of fruit, seasons of dormancy, seasons of pruning. Deep roots don't guarantee constant productivity. They guarantee sustainable fruitfulness over time.

**Leaf does not wither.** Even in drought—hard seasons when surface moisture evaporates, when emotions are dry, when external supports fail—the deeply rooted tree endures. Why? Because deep roots access water others can't reach.

**Whatever they do prospers.** Not prosperity gospel. This is organic flourishing. A well-rooted tree naturally prospers because it's connected to its source.

Stay rooted. The fruit will come. Not forced. Not manufactured. Organic. In season.

This picture of the tree by streams of water is beautiful. But here's what we need to understand: roots like these don't grow overnight. They require something most of us struggle with: time.

### 4. Roots Take Time

Here's what nobody tells you about deep roots: they take time. Years. Sometimes decades.

We live in an instant culture. We want microwavable transformation. Download the app, follow the seven steps, and boom—you're changed.

But roots don't work that way.

A tree doesn't shoot roots thirty feet down in a week. It takes seasons. Storm after storm. Drought after drought. Year after year, the roots slowly, steadily go deeper.

And for most of that time, you can't see the growth. Above ground, the tree might look unchanged. But below ground, everything is happening.

This is the hidden work of transformation. The work that happens when no one's watching. The work that doesn't make for dramatic testimonies because it's slow, steady, mostly invisible.

I'm fifteen years into this journey. And I'm still discovering shallow roots. Still finding places where I react instead of respond. Still uncovering bitterness I thought I'd released. Still learning to stay connected when I want to withdraw.

But I'm also seeing growth I couldn't see five years ago. Situations that would have wrecked me ten years ago now just... don't. Not because I'm stronger. Because the roots have gone deeper. I'm accessing streams I couldn't reach before.

This is the long obedience in the same direction. This is the slow work of becoming.

And it's worth it. Because when the drought comes—and it will come—deep roots mean the difference between withering and thriving.

> "A Christian is never in a state of completion but always in the process of becoming."
> — Martin Luther, *Lectures on Romans*

## Stories of Roots and Growth

**The Parable of the Sower (Matthew 13:1-23)**

Picture a farmer at sunrise, walking through his field with a bag of seed slung across his shoulder. He reaches in, pulls out a handful, and with a practiced motion scatters it in a wide arc. The seeds catch the light as they fly—some landing on the hardened path where people walk, some on the rocky outcropping at the field's edge, some among the tangle of thistles and thornbushes, and some on the rich, dark soil he's spent years cultivating.

The birds descend immediately on the path—quick, efficient, merciless. The seed never had a chance. Hard ground, no penetration, gone.

The rocky ground is more deceptive. Within days, bright green shoots push through the thin layer of soil. It looks promising—fast growth, visible progress. But underneath, the roots hit stone. They can't go deep. They spread sideways, searching for depth that isn't there. When the sun climbs high and hot, these plants are the first to wilt. No water reaches them. The shallow soil heats up. They brown, curl, die. Speed isn't the same as strength.

The thorny ground also shows promise at first. The seeds germinate, the plants grow. But so do the weeds. Thorns that were cut back last season return with a vengeance, growing faster, reaching higher. They don't kill the good plants outright—they just crowd them out. Steal their light. Choke their growth. The plants survive but never thrive, never fruit. They're strangled slowly by competition for resources.

But the good soil—this is different. The seeds sink in. The roots go down, spreading through soil that's been broken up, enriched, prepared. When the sun beats down, these roots reach moisture. When storms come, these roots hold firm. The plants grow steadily—not frantically, but surely. And when harvest comes, they're heavy with grain. Thirty, sixty, a hundred times what was planted.

The rocky ground is particularly relevant here:

> "The seed falling on rocky ground refers to someone who hears the word and at once receives it with joy. But since they have no root, they last only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes because of the word, they quickly fall away."
>
> — Matthew 13:20-21

No root. That's the problem. Enthusiasm without depth. Emotion without foundation.

The person receives the Word with joy—there's initial excitement, genuine response. But when heat comes, they wither. Why? No root.

This is the warning: don't settle for surface-level faith. Don't mistake initial enthusiasm for deep transformation. Send roots deep now—through sustained practices, patient trust, consistent rhythms—so when heat comes (and it will), you don't wither.

The good soil represents those who "hear the word, accept it, and produce a crop" (Mark 4:20). But even good soil requires cultivation. Weeding. Watering. Tending.

The disciplines are how you cultivate the soil of your soul so roots can go deep and fruit can come.

**The Vine and the Branches (John 15:1-8)**

Walk through a vineyard in late summer and you'll see the vine—thick, gnarled, ancient—with branches spreading out in all directions. Run your hand along a healthy branch and you can feel it: firm, supple, alive. The connection point where branch meets vine is seamless, organic. Sap flows from the vine through that connection, carrying nutrients, water, life itself.

Pick up a branch that's been cut off and the difference is immediate. It looks similar at first—same shape, same leaves. But touch it and you feel the brittleness. The leaves are already starting to brown at the edges. Give it a few days and it's completely dead, fit only for burning.

> "I am the vine; you are the branches. If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing."
>
> — John 15:5

The key word is "remain"—or "abide." This is the language of roots, of connection that sustains life. Branches don't try to produce fruit through effort or willpower. They remain connected to the vine. And fruit happens naturally, inevitably, organically.

You don't manufacture fruit through striving. You remain connected through sustained practices—prayer that keeps the conversation going, Scripture that keeps the life flowing, worship that keeps the heart open, community that keeps the connection strong. And fruit—love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control—grows the way grapes grow on a branch: not by trying, but by remaining.

But remaining requires intentionality. A branch doesn't have to work to stay connected, but it can be cut off if diseased. It can be pruned to produce more fruit. It can even choose to pull away from the vine. The vinedresser tends the branches carefully, cutting away what's dead, trimming back what's unproductive, ensuring that every branch that remains produces as much fruit as possible.

The unforced rhythms of grace aren't passive—they're active cooperation with God's life flowing into you. You position yourself under the flow. You remain in the connection. You abide in the relationship. And the fruit comes, not from your effort but from His life in you.

**Jeremiah's Promise (Jeremiah 17:7-8)**

Picture two trees in the same region during a drought year. The first tree stands alone in an open field, dependent entirely on rainfall. Its roots spread wide but shallow, searching for moisture that isn't there. As the rainless months stretch on, its leaves yellow, then brown. It drops them early, conserving what little moisture remains. It survives, barely, but produces no fruit this year. Maybe next year, if the rains return.

The second tree looks different even from a distance. Its leaves are deep green, almost glossy. It stands tall, full, healthy—not because it's stronger or more resilient by nature, but because of where it's planted: right by a stream. You can see its roots at the water's edge, thick and gnarled, disappearing into the mud. Those roots don't just touch the water—they're in it, drawing constantly from a source that doesn't depend on weather patterns.

> "But blessed is the one who trusts in the LORD, whose confidence is in him. They will be like a tree planted by the water that sends out its roots by the stream. It does not fear when heat comes; its leaves are always green. It has no worries in a year of drought and never fails to bear fruit."
>
> — Jeremiah 17:7-8

This is Jeremiah's promise, and it's built on trust and resilience.

**Trust as the foundation.** Your roots go where your trust is. If you trust yourself, roots stay shallow—limited by your capacity. If you trust God, roots go deep—accessing an infinite source.

**Does not fear when heat comes.** This is the promise: resilience. Heat will come. But deeply rooted trees don't fear it. Not because heat doesn't hurt, but because deep roots access water even when surface conditions are scorching.

**Never fails to bear fruit.** An even stronger promise than Psalm 1's "fruit in season." Why? Because the tree is constantly connected to the stream. It's not dependent on rainfall (external circumstances). It's rooted by a stream (constant internal source).

When you're deeply rooted in God, you don't become fruitless in hard seasons. The fruit might look different—not abundance, but endurance; not productivity, but presence. But you never fail to bear it.

## The Core Scripture Truth

**John 15:5-8** - "I am the vine; you are the branches. If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing. If you do not remain in me, you are like a branch that is thrown away and withers... This is to my Father's glory, that you bear much fruit, showing yourselves to be my disciples."

This is Jesus's teaching on remaining—on abiding. And it's the theological foundation for everything this chapter teaches about deep roots.

**"I am the vine; you are the branches."**

The relationship is organic, not mechanical. Not master and servant. Vine and branches. Living connection. Shared life. The sap that flows through the vine flows through the branches.

You're not disconnected from Jesus, trying to imitate Him from a distance. You're connected to Jesus, sharing His life.

**"If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit."**

The condition is remaining. Not striving. Not performing. Not white-knuckling your way to holiness. Remaining. Abiding. Staying connected.

And the promise is fruit. Not because you're trying to produce it. But because life is flowing from the vine into the branches. The fruit is inevitable when the connection is sustained.

**"Apart from me you can do nothing."**

This is both humbling and liberating. Humbling because it reminds you: you're not the source. You can't generate spiritual life through your own effort.

Liberating because it takes the pressure off. You don't have to produce. You just have to remain.

**"This is to my Father's glory, that you bear much fruit."**

The goal isn't your glory. It's the Father's. When you bear fruit—when love, joy, peace, patience, kindness grow in you—people see it and give glory to God.

Not because you're amazing. Because God's grace is transforming you.

This is the theological anchor: remain in Jesus. Let His words remain in you. And fruit will come—not forced, but organic. Not manufactured, but received. Not through your effort, but through your abiding.

Deep roots make abiding possible. And abiding makes fruit inevitable.

## The Wayfarer Moment

**Learning to trust the hidden work.**

For years, I equated spiritual growth with visible progress. I wanted to see results. Measure outcomes. Track my advancement.

If I couldn't see it, I questioned whether anything was actually happening.

But roots don't work that way.

The most important growth happens underground. Unseen. Unmeasured. Unremarkable to anyone watching.

Above ground, a tree might look unchanged for months. But below ground, roots are spreading, reaching, deepening. And that hidden work is what makes everything else possible.

I learned this the hard way. After coming out of the swamp, after encountering grace at the water's edge, I wanted instant transformation. I wanted to be different immediately—healed, whole, bearing fruit.

But God was growing roots.

There were days when I felt like nothing was changing. I'd pray and feel nothing. Read Scripture and feel unmoved. Gather with community and still feel alone.

But looking back now, I can see what was happening. Roots were going deep. Not dramatically. Not visibly. But steadily.

Through sustained practices. Through showing up even when I didn't feel like it. Through choosing connection over isolation. Through releasing bitterness and cultivating forgiveness.

The wayfarer moment came when I stopped measuring my progress by what I could see and started trusting the hidden work God was doing.

I stopped asking, "Why aren't I different yet?" and started asking, "Am I remaining in Him? Are my roots going deeper?"

Because here's what I've learned: surface-level change happens fast but doesn't last. Deep transformation happens slowly but endures.

You can manufacture behavior change through willpower. But it won't last. The first time stress hits, you'll revert to old patterns.

But deep roots—roots that reach down to streams of living water—create lasting stability. Not perfection. But resilience. Not arrival. But endurance.

I still have hard days. Days when I'm reactive instead of responsive. Days when I choose isolation over connection. Days when bitterness resurfaces and I have to forgive again.

But I don't panic anymore. Because I know: the roots are there. They're deep. And even when I can't see growth above ground, there's work happening below.

This is the invitation: trust the hidden work. Keep showing up. Keep practicing the disciplines. Keep remaining in Jesus. The fruit will come. In season. When roots are ready.

## Song Integration

The counselor looked at me and said, "You're doing all the right things, but your roots haven't gone deep enough yet."

I didn't want to hear that. I'd been practicing the rhythms for months. Showing up to prayer even when I didn't feel like it. Reading Scripture even when it felt dry. Staying connected to community even when I wanted to withdraw.

But I couldn't see results. I still struggled with the same issues. Still reacted defensively. Still battled pride. Still felt the pull of isolation.

I was discouraged, wondering: *Is any of this working? Am I actually growing? Or am I just going through the motions?*

The answer, I discovered, was that transformation happens underground before it's visible above the surface.

Then I read Psalm 1. And Jeremiah 17. And something clicked.

The tree planted by streams of water doesn't produce fruit immediately. First, roots go down. Deep. Searching for water. Anchoring in soil. Building the underground foundation that will support everything above ground.

The fruit comes later. In season. When roots are ready.

I was expecting visible growth—immediate fruit, dramatic change, measurable progress. But God was doing underground work. Sending my roots deeper. Teaching me to draw from living water instead of surface emotions.

Psalm 1 became my anchor. The image of a tree "replanted in Eden, bearing fresh fruit every month, never dropping a leaf, always in blossom"—that's not describing constant productivity. It's describing sustainable fruitfulness rooted in something deeper than circumstances.

The tree thrives not because it tries harder but because it's connected to a source of life that never runs dry.

That's when "I Will Trust You Lord" was born. The song is a declaration: even when I can't see growth, even when the work feels invisible, even when drought comes—my roots are going deep. I'm planted by streams of living water. And I will trust the hidden work.

The chorus captures the promise: "Like a tree beside the river, I will stand so tall. Through the fire, through the season, You're my all in all."

Not standing because I'm strong. Standing because I'm rooted. Not thriving because conditions are perfect. Thriving because I'm drawing from a source deeper than circumstances.

The bridge confronts the fears: "No fear in the drought... No doubt in the storm... Your love is my anchor... I'll trust You, Lord."

This isn't denial. It's confidence. Rooted confidence that says: I can face drought because my roots go deeper than surface water. I can weather storms because I'm anchored in something immovable.

When I sing this now, it reminds me: the work happening underground is just as real—maybe more real—than the work visible above ground. And if I'll trust the process, keep showing up, keep putting roots down deep, the fruit will come.

In season. When roots are ready.

## Key Takeaways

- **Roots determine resilience.** Surface growth impresses, but deep roots sustain. When drought comes, shallow plants wither while deeply rooted trees stay green—not through effort, but through connection to living water.
- **Put pride, reactivity, isolation, and bitterness to death.** These keep roots shallow. Replace them with humility, responsiveness, connection, and forgiveness to create conditions for deep growth.
- **Remain in the vine; fruit follows naturally.** You don't manufacture spiritual fruit through striving. You stay connected to Jesus through sustained practices, and transformation flows from that abiding relationship.
- **Trust the hidden work.** The most important growth happens underground, unseen and unmeasured. Keep showing up, keep practicing, keep remaining—the roots are going deeper than you realize.

---
## Reflections for the Road

**Questions for the Journey:**
- What needs to die so roots can go deep? Where is pride keeping you shallow? Where is reactivity preventing growth? Where is isolation cutting you off? Where is bitterness poisoning the soil?
- What practices position you by the stream? Prayer? Scripture? Sabbath? Solitude? Worship? Community? Are you practicing them consistently?
- Where are you trying to manufacture fruit instead of remaining in the vine? Are you striving to be more loving? Trying harder to be joyful? White-knuckling your way to peace?
- What does "fruit in season" mean for you right now? Not every season is fruitful. Some are for growth. Some for pruning. Some for rest. What season are you in?

## Practice: Cultivating Deep Roots

Here's a simple framework for sending roots deep through spiritual disciplines:

### 1. Daily: Drink from the stream
Choose one practice that connects you to God daily. Morning prayer and Scripture. Lectio divina. Journaling. Listening prayer in silence. The practice matters less than the consistency.

### 2. Weekly: Sabbath rest
Set aside one day (or a few hours) each week for Sabbath. Not as legalism. As gift. Stop striving so you can receive rest. Stop producing so you can receive belovedness.

### 3. Monthly: Solitude and silence
Once a month, create extended space for solitude. A few hours. A half day. A full day if possible. Intentional time alone with God. Away from noise, hurry, screens, people. Listen. Rest. Let God search your heart.

### 4. Seasonally: Examine your roots
Every few months, review: Are my roots going deeper? Or am I staying shallow? Am I more reactive or more responsive? More isolated or more connected? More bitter or more forgiving?

### 5. Community: Grow in groves
Trees don't grow in isolation. Their roots intertwine with other roots. You need community. Real community. Where you can confess struggles, receive prayer, offer encouragement, practice forgiveness, serve together.

You're standing at the base of an ancient tree. Massive. Towering. Its canopy spreads wide, providing shade for acres.

How long has this tree been here? A hundred years? Two hundred? More?

You walk closer and place your hand on the trunk. Solid. Rough. Weathered by countless storms. Scarred by lightning strikes. Marked by seasons of growth and seasons of pruning.

But still standing.

You look up into the branches. Birds nest there. Squirrels scamper. Life thrives in the shelter this tree provides.

And then you look down. At the base. Where roots disappear into the earth.

You can't see them. But you know they're there. Reaching deep. Spreading wide. Anchoring this massive tree so firmly that no storm can topple it.

The roots are why the tree stands.

This is the invitation: send your roots deep. Not for show. Not for applause. Not even for immediate fruit.

For stability. For resilience. For sustainable life.

The work happens underground. In the quiet. In the daily practices. In the sustained rhythms. In the patient trust.

You won't always see results. You won't always feel growth. You won't always sense progress.

But if you remain—if you keep showing up, keep practicing the disciplines, keep choosing connection over isolation, keep releasing bitterness and cultivating forgiveness—the roots will go deep.

And when heat comes, you won't fear. When drought arrives, you won't worry. When storms rage, you won't be uprooted.

Because your roots—hidden, deep, sustained by streams of living water—will hold.

Like a tree planted by streams of water. Leaves green. Fruit in season. Soul strong.

Deeply rooted in the love of God.
