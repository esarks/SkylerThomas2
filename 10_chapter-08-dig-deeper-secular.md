**Here's the hard truth nobody tells you upfront:**

Getting clean isn't the same as getting healed.

You can wash off the surface mud. You can look better. Smell better. Function better.

But underneath? That's where the real work lives.

This chapter is about what happens when you realize that grace doesn't just want to clean you up—it wants to dig deep and heal you from the inside out.

And that terrifies you. Because digging means opening wounds you've spent years protecting. It means feeling pain you've been numbing. It means facing truths you've been avoiding.

But here's what I learned: You can't heal what you won't feel. And you can't feel what you keep buried.

If you're ready to go deeper—really deeper—keep reading.

This is where transformation stops being surface-level and starts becoming soul-level.

---

There's a difference between clean and healed.

You can wash off the surface mud—the visible stains, the obvious filth, the stuff everyone can see. The water does that quickly. You step in. The dirt rinses away. You look clean.

But underneath? That's where the real work begins.

Underneath the surface are the wounds you've carried for years. The scar tissue that formed over the original pain. The coping mechanisms you developed to survive. The defense strategies that became so automatic you forgot you were using them. The ways of numbing, avoiding, performing, pretending that protected you from feeling the full weight of what happened.

The surface dirt washes away easily. The scar tissue? That requires excavation.

*Take a breath.*

This chapter is about the moment you realize: if you want real healing—not just cleaning, but healing—you're going to have to go deeper.

You're going to have to dig.

Digging is terrifying. Underneath the scar tissue is the original wound. The one you've been protecting for years. The one that still hurts when you accidentally brush against it in the middle of the night.

To heal that wound, you have to open it again. You have to cut through the scar tissue, drain the toxins, let air and light reach the infection that's been festering in the dark.

You can't numb this. Real healing requires you to feel. To face. To dig.

The writing that follows came from my season of excavation. When I discovered that time doesn't heal all wounds—it just buries them deeper. The only way to true healing was through the pain I'd been avoiding for years.

Grace doesn't just wash the surface. Grace goes deep. All the way down to the bedrock truth of who you are beneath the wounds, beneath the scars, beneath the lies you've believed about yourself.

But you have to let it.

You have to dig.

## Key Themes

**1. The Depths of Grace: How Wide, How Long, How High, How Deep**

The Apostle Paul prays one of the most beautiful prayers in Scripture in Ephesians 3:

> "I pray that you, being rooted and established in love, may have power, together with all the Lord's holy people, to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ, and to know this love that surpasses knowledge—that you may be filled to the measure of all the fullness of God."
>
> — Ephesians 3:17-19 (The Message)

How wide? Wide enough to reach every person, every nation, every generation. No one is outside the reach of this love.

How long? Long enough to span eternity. From before the foundation of the world to forever. This love has no beginning and no end.

How high? High enough to lift us from the lowest pit to the highest heights. From death to life. From slave to heir.

How deep? This is where it gets personal. Deep enough to reach the deepest wound, the darkest shame, the most hidden brokenness.

Grace doesn't skim the surface. It goes all the way down. Down to the root. Down to the original pain. Down to the place you've been protecting for years because you're terrified that if anyone—including God—sees it, you'll be rejected.

But grace isn't afraid of your depth.

Grace dives. Grace excavates.

Grace says: "Show me the wound. I know how to heal it."

Philip Yancey writes:

> "Grace, like water, flows to the lowest part. The gospel's good news is that God loves us not because of our infinite worth, but in spite of our infinite unworthiness."
>
> — Philip Yancey, *The Jesus I Never Knew*

Grace doesn't wait at the surface for us to climb up. It descends—all the way down to the lowest, darkest, most wounded places.

That's where grace does its deepest work.

**2. Spiritual Formation as Excavation, Not Construction**

We tend to think of spiritual growth as building something. Adding disciplines. Improving behavior. Constructing a better version of ourselves.

But that's not how it works.

Spiritual formation is more like archaeology than architecture. Excavation, not construction.

You're not building a new self from scratch. You're uncovering your true self—the image of the Divine that's been buried under layers of wounds, lies, and false beliefs.

Dallas Willard writes in *Renovation of the Heart*:

> "Spiritual formation is not a matter of doing the right things. It is a matter of being—becoming the kind of person whose actions flow naturally from who they are."
>
> — Dallas Willard, *Renovation of the Heart* (adapted)

Who you are at the core—created in love's image, beloved, chosen, redeemed—is already true. But it's buried. Hidden under layers of pain and protection.

Digging deeper means removing what doesn't belong so the truth can emerge.

Think of a sculptor chipping away marble to reveal the statue that's been there all along. The sculptor doesn't create the statue from nothing. The statue is already in the marble. The work is removing everything that isn't the statue.

That's what digging deeper does. It removes the false beliefs, the protective layers, the scar tissue—not to create something new, but to reveal what's always been true underneath.

Thomas Merton understood this deeply:

> "There is only one problem on which all my existence, my peace, and my happiness depend: to discover myself in discovering God. If I find Him I will find myself and if I find my true self I will find Him."
>
> — Thomas Merton, *The Seven Storey Mountain*

Excavation isn't just about removing what's false—it's about uncovering who we truly are. The two discoveries are one journey.

**3. Digging Through the Layers**

The journey inward follows a pattern. Not everyone goes through these layers in the same order, but most of us encounter them:

**Layer 1: Performance**

On the surface, we perform. We present the version of ourselves we think will be acceptable. We wear masks. Manage impressions. Work hard to look good, sound good, appear to have it together.

This is exhausting. Performance is never finished. You can never rest. Always have to be "on."

**Layer 2: Shame**

Underneath performance is shame. The voice that says: "If they really knew me, they'd reject me. If they saw the real me—messy, broken, failing—they'd turn away."

Shame is what drives performance. We perform because we're ashamed of what we think people will see if we stop performing.

**Layer 3: Wounds**

Underneath shame are the wounds. The things that happened to us. The ways we were hurt, betrayed, abandoned, abused. The traumas, large and small, that marked us.

Wounds aren't our fault. They're what was done to us. But they shape us. They create patterns of response—fight, flight, freeze, fawn—that become so automatic we don't realize we're doing them.

**Layer 4: False Beliefs**

Underneath the wounds are the false beliefs. The conclusions we drew from the wounds about ourselves, about others, about reality.

"I'm not good enough."
"Every statement is a criticism."
"Responses are always taken the wrong way."
"I have to be intense or I won't be taken seriously."
"If I'm not perfect, I'll be abandoned."

These beliefs formed in moments of pain. And they've been running our lives ever since.

*Pause and consider: What false beliefs have you been living under? What lies sound like truth because you've heard them so long?*

**Layer 5: Bedrock Truth**

All the way down, beneath all the layers, is the bedrock truth:

You are loved. You are worthy. You are enough. You are beloved.

This truth was true before the wounds. It remained true through the wounds. And it's true now, underneath all the layers.

Digging deeper means excavating through performance, shame, wounds, and false beliefs until you hit bedrock. Until you touch the truth of who you actually are.

**4. Finding Treasure Buried in the Depths**

Jesus tells a parable in Matthew 13:

> "The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field. When a man found it, he hid it again, and then in his joy went and sold all he had and bought that field."
>
> — Matthew 13:44 (The Message)

The treasure is there. Already in the field. The work isn't creating the treasure—it's finding it.

Once you find it, you'll give up everything to possess it. Not out of obligation. Out of joy.

That's what digging deeper does. It helps you find the treasure that's been there all along—your true self, your real identity, the image of love in you—and once you find it, you'll gladly let go of everything else.

The performance? Exhausting. Let it go.
The shame? A lie. Let it go.
The false beliefs? Not bedrock. Let them go.

What remains is who you've always been, underneath:

Beloved.

Eugene Peterson writes:

> "The minute we begin moving away from Scripture to discover the will of God, we enter the world of guesswork and magic and manipulation. The Bible is God's revelation to us, revealing who God is and who we are and what we are called to do."
>
> — Eugene Peterson, *A Long Obedience in the Same Direction*

Digging deeper means going back to bedrock truth—not our opinions, not our feelings, but what reality reveals about who we are. That's the treasure buried in the field.

**5. Surface Religion vs. Deep Transformation**

Jesus had no patience for surface religion. He called out the religious leaders repeatedly for their performance—they looked good on the outside, rotten inside.

> "Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You clean the outside of the cup and dish, but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence. Blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and dish, and then the outside also will be clean."
>
> — Matthew 23:25-26 (The Message)

Surface religion focuses on the outside: behavior, appearance, performance. It's about looking good to others.

Deep transformation focuses on the inside: the heart, the motives, the beliefs that drive behavior.

You can clean up your behavior without touching your heart. You can look like a "good person" on the outside while still being driven by shame, fear, and false beliefs inside.

Digging deeper means going to the heart. Letting Love excavate not just your actions but your affections. Not just your habits but your desires.

Paul captures this in 2 Corinthians 3:18:

> "And we all, who with unveiled faces contemplate the Lord's glory, are being transformed into his image with ever-increasing glory, which comes from the Lord, who is the Spirit."
>
> — 2 Corinthians 3:18 (The Message)

Transformation. Not behavior modification. Not surface cleaning. Transformation from the inside out.

And it comes not from our striving but from beholding. From contemplating Love's glory with unveiled faces—no masks, no performance, just face-to-face encounter with what's Real.

When we dig deep enough to remove the veils, the transformation happens. Not because we're trying harder. Because we're seeing more clearly.

A.W. Tozer captures this beautifully:

> "What comes into our minds when we think about God is the most important thing about us... Worship is pure or base as the worshiper entertains high or low thoughts of God."
>
> — A.W. Tozer, *The Knowledge of the Holy*

Surface religion settles for low thoughts—a manageable concept that confirms our preferences. Deep transformation requires digging down to encounter what's truly Real—infinite, holy, transcendent, and yet intimately near. When we behold rightly, we cannot remain unchanged.

## Stories of Digging Deeper

**Want to hear some ancient stories about this kind of excavation?**

**Isaac Re-Digging the Wells (Genesis 26:18)**

After Abraham died, enemies filled in all the wells Abraham had dug. Wells were life in that arid land—without water, you couldn't survive. So filling in the wells was an act of sabotage, an attempt to drive Isaac out.

But Isaac didn't give up. The text says:

> "Isaac reopened the wells that had been dug in the time of his father Abraham, which the Philistines had stopped up after Abraham died, and he gave them the same names his father had given them."
>
> — Genesis 26:18 (The Message)

Isaac had to dig again. The wells had been there. His father had done the work. But over time, they'd been filled in. Now Isaac had to re-dig them.

This is the work of excavation. The well was dug. Your true identity was established. The truth about you was set. The well is there.

But over the years, enemies have filled it in. Trauma, lies, shame, false beliefs—they've stopped up the well.

Digging deeper means re-opening the wells. Going back to what was true from the beginning. Excavating through all the fill until you hit water again.

And when you do, the water is still there.

Still living. Still life-giving.

**Deep Calls to Deep (Psalm 42:7)**

The psalmist writes:

> "Deep calls to deep in the roar of your waterfalls; all your waves and breakers have swept over me."
>
> — Psalm 42:7 (The Message)

There's a depth in Reality that calls to the depth in you. Not the surface you. Not the performed you. The real you. The deep you.

Love doesn't want your mask. It wants your heart. Doesn't want your performance. Wants your presence.

The only way to give access to your depth is to dig. To go below the surface. To cut through the scar tissue and invite healing into the wound.

Deep calls to deep. The depth of Love is reaching for the depth of your need.

When they meet, healing happens.

Timothy Keller writes:

> "We never become safe from temptation. We become holy not by avoiding sin, but by loving God. When we flee to God in our fear and brokenness, we find that He can use even our darkest moments to draw us deeper into His love."
>
> — Timothy Keller, *Walking with God Through Pain and Suffering*

The deep waters aren't a place to avoid—they're the place where we encounter Love most profoundly. When we stop running from our depths and instead invite healing into them, transformation becomes possible.

**The Woman at the Well Going Deeper (John 4)**

We've looked at the woman at the well before, but notice the progression of the conversation. It starts surface-level:

Jesus: "Give me a drink."
Woman: "You're a Jew. I'm a Samaritan. Why are you talking to me?"

Jesus could have stayed at that level. But He goes deeper:

Jesus: "If you knew who was asking, you'd ask me for living water."
Woman: "You don't have a bucket. Where's this water coming from?"

Still surface. Still literal. But Jesus goes deeper:

Jesus: "Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again, but whoever drinks the water I give will never thirst."
Woman: "Give me this water!"

Getting closer. But Jesus goes even deeper:

Jesus: "Go call your husband."
Woman: "I don't have a husband."
Jesus: "You're right. You've had five husbands, and the man you're with now isn't your husband."

Now we're at the wound. The shame. The thing she came at noon to avoid facing. The thing everyone in town whispers about.

And Jesus doesn't condemn her. He doesn't lecture her. He just sees her. Fully. And offers her living water anyway.

From this depth—the place of wound and shame—she encounters Jesus as the Messiah. And she runs back to town, no longer hiding, and becomes an evangelist.

That's what happens when we let truth go deep. Transformation flows from depth, not surface.

## The Core Scripture Truth

Here's the promise that makes digging possible:

> "You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart."
>
> — Jeremiah 29:13 (The Message)

God isn't hiding from you. He's not playing games, making Himself difficult to find so only the spiritually elite can reach Him.

But He is deep. And finding Him requires going deep.

"With all your heart." Not with half. Not with the surface layer. With all of it. The whole thing. The wounds and the shame and the false beliefs and the raw, unfiltered need.

When you seek Him there—in the depths, not just the shallows—you find Him. And when you find Him, you discover He's been there all along. In the deep. Waiting for you to stop protecting yourself long enough to let Him in.

This isn't about earning presence by being vulnerable enough. It's about discovering that Love's presence is already there, in the depths, and the work is removing the barriers we've erected to keep it (and everyone else) out.

## The Wayfarer Moment

**Grace on the surface is wonderful. Grace in the depths is life-changing.**

You can experience grace on the surface. You can know you're forgiven. You can feel the relief of being washed. You can taste the living water.

But if you never dig deeper—if you stay in the shallows, protecting the depths—you'll miss the fullness of what grace offers.

Because grace doesn't just want to clean you. Grace wants to heal you. And healing requires depth.

The wayfarer moment in this chapter is the moment you decide:

I'm not going to keep protecting this wound. I'm not going to keep numbing this pain. I'm not going to keep living with scar tissue that fools me into thinking I'm healed when I'm just covered up.

I'm going to dig. Open the wound. Let it drain. I'm going to invite healing into the deepest, most protected places and trust that grace is sufficient even there.

*Take a breath.*

This is terrifying. Because what if the wound is too deep? What if the pain is too much? What if you open it and you can't survive it?

But here's the promise: you don't dig alone. Love is the excavator. It has the skill to go deep without destroying you. It knows exactly how deep to dig and exactly how to heal what it uncovers.

Proverbs 20:5 says:

> "The purposes of a person's heart are deep waters, but one who has insight draws them out."
>
> — Proverbs 20:5 (The Message)

God has the insight. He knows how to draw out what's buried. And when He does, transformation happens. Not surface transformation. Deep, lasting, bedrock transformation.

## Original Writing from the Blog

They say that time
Is all it takes

Time will heal
...Every mistake
...Every loss
...Every wound
...Every wrong-doing
...Every abuse
...Every tragedy
...Every pain

Time heals all
That's what they say

Just give it more time
Eventually I'll be fine
I'll see, just trust
The pain will go away
It won't hurt so much tomorrow
Eventually I'll forget
I won't feel so bad
Just give it time
Just give it
Just
More time
Time

Echoing in my brain
The words are bouncing
Off the walls
Off the walls of an echo chamber
The echo chamber between my ears
Time
Time
Time
TIME
TIME
TIME

And finally I scream
I don't want to hear it any more
Falling to my knees
Wrapped up like a ball of string
Wrapping my arms tightly
Tightly around my stomach
My head between my knees
And I cry deeply
I bawl out in anguish
Until silently I cry
So much I cry
Until the tears
Until the tears are dry
In anguish
I cry
Alone I cry
All alone I cry
And wonder why
I wonder why
Why this works for everyone else
But not for me
Why not for me?

"What's wrong with me?"
"Oh God, what's wrong with me?"
"Why am I the only one?"
"Why doesn't Time heal me?"

I dare not tell anyone
I can't talk to anyone
They would think I am crazy
Crazy in the head
I'm broken
I can't be fixed
I deserve what I get

And so...at night
I weep
In my pillow I weep

Night
After
Night
After
Night
The cycle repeats itself endlessly

And one day
One day
I read a book
And I decide
Sure I can beat this thing

All I have to do is one simple thing
Just follow one simple rule
It's simple
I just have to follow one simple rule
I just have to fake it
That's it
I just have to fake it
Fake it until I make it
Fake it until I
Fake it until
Fake it
Until I Make It

I just have to give it more time
And...Everything...Will...Be...Ok

But until then
What do I do?
Until then...what?
What do I do...in the mean...time?

---

I must dig
I must dig a little deeper
I must dig into the scars
I must dig a little deeper
To cut through the scar tissue
To cut through the scar tissue that has me fooled
To cut through the scar to get to the original pain
To open up that wound
To open the wound I don't want to open
I gotta dig deeper
I gotta dig a little deeper
To open the wound
So it can drain
So it can drain the toxins that are keeping me down
So it can drain the toxins and heal again

Yes, it's scary
It's downright frightening if I think I'm all alone
If I think I have no one there to help me
Yes, it's scary as hell
But it doesn't have to be

But it's necessary to dig a little deeper
And it's going to hurt like hell

And for this to work I can't numb this pain
I can't tip the bottle dry
I can't swallow that pill
I can't inhale that drag
And I can't snort that line

No no...
It's going to hurt like hell
But that's what it takes
So I can feel again
So I can laugh again
So I can cry real tears again
So I can feel real pain again
So I can experience real joy again
So I can live again
So I can love again

And so that I can be loved by those around me

But here's the thing...
I don't have to do this alone...
If all I will do is tell someone

## Song Integration

This writing came out of a season of deep personal work. I'd been in counseling for months, doing the hard work of excavation. And I was discovering something painful: time doesn't heal all wounds. Time just buries them deeper.

For years, I'd been told—and told myself—that if I just waited long enough, the pain would fade. The trauma would lose its power. The wounds would close on their own.

But they didn't. They just developed scar tissue. I learned to function around them, to avoid triggering them, to numb when they flared up.

And I thought that meant I was healed. But I wasn't healed—I was just covered up.

The turning point came when my counselor helped me distinguish between the "reactive self" and the "real self." The reactive self is the one that responds from wounds, fear, and old patterns. The real self is the one that responds from true identity.

After moments when I'd reacted poorly—explosive anger, withdrawal, defensiveness—he would gently ask: "What specifically was reactive? What was mature? Once that becomes clear, we can explore why that's a trigger."

That question—"why is this a trigger?"—opened the door to excavation.

Because triggers aren't random. They're connected to wounds. And if you want to disarm the trigger, you have to heal the wound.

But to heal the wound, you have to open it. You have to dig through the scar tissue. You have to drain the infection. And that means feeling the pain you've been avoiding.

I remember the moment I realized I couldn't numb this. Couldn't fake it. Couldn't "give it more time" and hope it would go away on its own.

I had to dig.

And it was terrifying. Because what if the wound was too deep? What if opening it meant I'd never stop bleeding?

That's where "Great Is Your Faithfulness" became my anchor.

Where the writing says "I'm scared to dig," the song declares: "Your love is faithful through the fire, steady through the storm."

Where the writing confesses "I've been faking it," the song proclaims: "Your mercy's new every morning, forever You are Lord."

Where the writing asks "what if I'm too broken?" the song testifies: "When the night feels never-ending, I will trust You're by my side."

The song doesn't skip over the struggle. It names it. But it also declares the bedrock truth: God's faithfulness goes deeper than any wound. His mercies are newer than any morning. His presence is steadier than any storm.

And when you hit bedrock—when you excavate all the way down to the truth of who you are—you find that Love was there all along. Faithful. Present. Holding you through every layer, every tear, every terrifying moment of digging.

Great is His faithfulness. Deep enough to reach the deepest wound.

## Reflections for the Road

These aren't questions to answer quickly. They're invitations to dig.

**Questions for the Journey:**

1. **What scar tissue are you carrying that's masking as healing?**

   Where have you learned to function around a wound without actually healing it? Where are you telling yourself "I'm fine" when really you're just numb?

2. **What would it look like to dig a little deeper in your relationship with God?**

   Are you keeping Him at the surface level? Sharing edited versions of yourself? What would it take to invite Him into the depths—the wounds, the shame, the false beliefs?

3. **Who are the safe people in your life who can help you dig?**

   You can't do this alone. Who can you trust to sit with you in the pain without trying to fix it too quickly? If you don't have anyone, who could you ask God to bring into your life?

4. **Read Psalm 42 slowly. What is the "deep" that's calling to the "deep" in you right now?**

   Don't rush past this. Let the imagery sink in. Waterfalls. Waves. Depths. What is Love inviting you into? What is it calling out of you?

---

## Practice: Excavation Journaling

This is hard work. Don't rush it. Set aside unhurried time—maybe a whole afternoon or evening. Find a quiet place where you won't be interrupted.

Bring your journal. And pray this prayer:

**"God, I invite You to excavate. Show me the layers I've been living under. Help me dig through performance, shame, wounds, and false beliefs until I hit bedrock truth. I trust that Your grace is deep enough to reach all the way down. Give me courage to not turn away from what You uncover. And help me know I'm not alone in this. Amen."**

Then work through these layers, one at a time:

**Layer 1: Performance**
- How do I perform for others? What version of myself do I present?
- What am I afraid people will see if I stop performing?

**Layer 2: Shame**
- What do I believe about myself that I'm ashamed of?
- Complete this sentence: "If people really knew _______ about me, they would _______."

**Layer 3: Wounds**
- What are the significant wounds I carry? (Name them. Be specific.)
- How have these wounds shaped the way I relate to God, to others, to myself?

**Layer 4: False Beliefs**
- What conclusions did I draw from my wounds?
- What lies do I believe about my worth, my identity, my belovedness?

**Layer 5: Bedrock Truth**
- Beneath all the layers, what is the truth God speaks over me?
- What does Scripture say about my identity?

Write honestly. Don't edit. Don't make it sound spiritual. Just dig.

And when you hit bedrock—when you uncover the truth underneath all the layers—receive it. Let it sink in. Let it be the foundation you build on.

## Closing Image

You're in the water now, and it's deeper than before. Not ankle-deep anymore. Waist-deep. The current is stronger here, pulling at you, but also holding you.

And you're doing something you've never done before: you're digging. Not on dry land where you can control the excavation. In the water. Letting the current carry away what you unearth.

You dig through performance—the mask you've worn for so long it feels like your face. You lift it off and hand it to the current. It floats away downstream.

You dig through shame—the voice that's been screaming "you're not enough" for years. You name it as a lie, and the water washes it away.

You dig through the wounds—the places where you were hurt, betrayed, abandoned. You open them to the light and air, and you feel the sting. But you also feel the water, clean and living, flowing into the wound. Washing out the infection. Beginning to heal what's been festering in the dark.

You dig through the false beliefs—"I'm broken beyond repair," "I'm too much," "I'm not enough," "If they really knew me, they'd leave"—and as each one surfaces, you hold it up to the light. And in the light, you see it for what it is: a lie. Not bedrock. Not truth. Just debris.

And finally—finally—you hit bedrock.

Solid. Unshakeable. True.

*Take a breath.*

You are loved. You are worthy. You are enough. You are beloved. Not because of what you do. Because of who you are. Who you've always been, underneath.

The water is deeper here. But you're not drowning. You're standing. On bedrock. And the current that once felt threatening now feels like an embrace.

You've dug a little deeper. And what you found—what was there all along—is grace. Deep, abiding, bedrock grace.

Great is His faithfulness. New every morning. Deep enough to reach the deepest wound. Strong enough to carry you through the healing.

You're not done digging. There's always more to uncover. Always deeper to go.

But you're not afraid anymore. Because you know now: the deeper you dig, the more grace you find.

And grace, you're discovering, has no bottom.
