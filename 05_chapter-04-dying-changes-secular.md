Someone once said: "Almost dying changes little. Dying changes everything."

You can come close to the edge, peek over, and walk back unchanged. You can almost hit bottom and still cling to the old life. Almost-dying gives you a scare, maybe a wake-up call. But it doesn't transform you.

Dying does.

I'm not talking about biological death. I'm talking about the psychological, spiritual deaths we must undergo if we're going to truly live. The deaths that happen daily—to old patterns, false selves, broken ways of being.

Because here's what they don't tell you when you first commit to change: that initial decision wasn't the end of dying. It was the beginning.

The swamp you've been living in has nothing to do with that person who once decided to get better, to be healthier, to live differently. That person believed. That person meant it. But life happened. Pain accumulated. False selves formed. Old patterns crept back. And the death that needs to happen now is different from the transformation you imagined back then.

There's a moment in every healing journey when you realize: something has to die.

Maybe it's a relationship that's turned toxic. Maybe it's a dream that's become an obsession. Maybe it's the version of yourself you've been clinging to—the capable one, the strong one, the one who has it all together. Maybe it's your understanding of reality—the tame, manageable version you created to feel safe.

Something has to die. And you know it.

*Take a breath.*

Death feels like defeat. Failure. The end.

But what if death is the beginning?

The writing that follows came from my two deaths—once to my old self, once to my illusions about how life works. Both felt like endings. Both turned out to be grace.

Before resurrection, there must be a tomb.

## Key Themes

**1. Death as Transformation**

Death in spiritual literature is rarely just biological cessation. It's transformation. Passage. Transition.

Here are the different kinds of death we experience:
- Death to the false self - the person we've performed being, not who we actually are
- Death to illusions - the stories we've told ourselves about how life should work
- Death to control - the grip we've held on outcomes, other people, our futures
- Death to the life we planned so we can live the life that's actually here

Dallas Willard taught that transformation requires this kind of death:

> "The greatest issue facing the world today, with all its heartbreaking needs, is whether those who, by profession or culture, are identified as 'people of conscience' will become practitioners of love—students, apprentices—steadily learning how to live the life of wholeness into every corner of human existence. Will they break out of their isolation to be a mighty force for good on earth, drawing the hearts and bodies of the world toward healing with the irresistible power of love?"
>
> — Dallas Willard, *The Divine Conspiracy* (adapted)

The death of my ministry felt like the death of myself. I'd poured everything into it—my identity, my worth, my purpose. When it crumbled under the weight of my own moral failure, I didn't know who I was.

My moral decay didn't just end a ministry. It severed me from the community I'd grown so close to. The people who knew me, trusted me, looked to me—gone. Not because they abandoned me, but because my choices had consequences. Real, devastating, life-altering consequences.

I remember the night I finally admitted it was over. The ministry I'd built. The reputation I'd cultivated. The leader I'd pretended to be.

All of it—dead.

But here's what I didn't understand then: reality wasn't destroying me out of anger. Life was dismantling the false version of me I'd built. Killing the performer who wore righteousness like a costume. Killing my addiction to approval, to respect, to being seen as the spiritual one.

The false self had to die so the true self could begin to live.

**2. The Death of the False Self**

The false self is the person you've been pretending to be. The mask you wear. The performance you give. The image you maintain. Richard Rohr contrasts the true self (the person you were created to be, your authentic essence) with the false self (the person you think you need to be to survive, to be loved, to matter).

> "The false self is who we think we are. It is our mental self-image and social agreement, which most people spend their whole lives living up to—or down to. It is all a fictional creation. The true self is who we objectively are from the beginning, in the deepest pattern of our being. It is our substantial self, who we are in our unique DNA, and our absolute core, where wholeness dwells. Thus, for the True Self, there is nothing to prove and nothing to protect. It lives in conscious connection with what's Real."
>
> — Richard Rohr, *Immortal Diamond* (adapted)

The false self is built on:
- What people expect
- What earns approval
- What feels safe
- What maintains control

The false self says:
- "If people knew the real me, they'd reject me"
- "I have to perform to be loved"
- "Vulnerability is weakness"
- "I am what I accomplish"

Thomas Merton understood this deeply:

> "Every one of us is shadowed by an illusory person: a false self. We are not very good at recognizing illusions, least of all the ones we cherish about ourselves. This is the man I want myself to be but who cannot exist, because Reality does not know anything about him. And to be unknown of Reality is altogether too much privacy. My false and private self is the one who wants to exist outside the reach of truth and love—outside of reality and outside of life. And such a self cannot help but be an illusion."
>
> — Thomas Merton, *New Seeds of Contemplation* (adapted)

The death of the false self is terrifying because it feels like losing yourself.

But you're not losing yourself. You're losing the prison you've been living in.

| **The False Self** | **The True Self** |
|--------------------|-------------------|
| Performs for approval | Rests in acceptance |
| Fears exposure | Practices honesty |
| Hides weakness | Confesses need |
| Image-management | Authenticity |
| Exhausting | Life-giving |

**3. Dying to Control, Certainty, Performance**

Control is one of the hardest things to surrender. We want to manage outcomes. Predict futures. Protect ourselves from pain.

Certainty is another. We want answers, not mysteries. Clear paths, not ambiguity. Solid ground, not shifting sand.

Performance is how we try to earn what life offers freely: acceptance, love, belonging.

All three have to die.

**Dying to Control:**

The death of control feels like freefall.

But it's not. It's falling into the arms of what's been holding you all along—the reality that you were never actually in control, and that's okay.

Henri Nouwen, in his own descent into vulnerability, wrote:

> "The spiritual life is not a life before, after, or beyond our everyday existence. No, the spiritual life can only be real when it is lived in the midst of the pains and joys of the here and now. We cannot search for spiritual things as if they had nothing to do with the material world. All things—a glass of water, a walk in the woods, a chair, a table—are spiritual. Life is visible and present in all things. To live a spiritual life means to fully claim our daily existence."
>
> — Henri Nouwen, *The Inner Voice of Love* (adapted)

**Dying to Certainty:**

This is hard for many of us because we've been taught doubt is weakness.

But actually, clinging to certainty is the opposite of faith. Real trust requires living in the midst of mystery.

The death of false certainty opens space for a bigger, truer understanding of reality.

**Dying to Performance:**

You can't earn love. You can't perform your way to acceptance. Every effort to prove yourself is just another attempt at self-justification that exhausts your soul.

Brennan Manning exposed this trap:

> "My deepest awareness of myself is that I am deeply loved and I have done nothing to earn it or deserve it. The impostor is the false self shaped by others' expectations. The death of the impostor is the beginning of life. We don't have to be smart, successful, or accomplished enough. We simply have to be real."
>
> — Brennan Manning, *Abba's Child* (adapted)

The death of performance means you stop. You rest. You receive. You let yourself be loved not because you're impressive, but because you're human.

**4. Why Resurrection Requires a Tomb**

You can't be raised unless you've died. You can't experience transformation unless you've been in the darkness.

There's a Saturday between Friday and Sunday. Between the death and the resurrection, there's a tomb. Dark. Silent. Seemingly final.

C.S. Lewis understood this paradox of death and life:

> "The principle runs through all life from top to bottom. Give up yourself, and you will find your real self. Lose your life and you will save it. Submit to death, death of your ambitions and favourite wishes every day and death of your whole body in the end: submit with every fibre of your being, and you will find eternal life. Keep back nothing. Nothing that you have not given away will ever be really yours. Nothing in you that has not died will ever be raised from the dead. Look for yourself, and you will find in the long run only hatred, loneliness, despair, rage, ruin, and decay. But look for what's Real and you will find it, and with it everything else thrown in."
>
> — C.S. Lewis, *Mere Christianity* (adapted)

Most of us live on Saturday. We've experienced death—of dreams, relationships, certainties, selves—and we're waiting in the tomb. We know about transformation theoretically, but we're living in Saturday emotionally.

The tomb is part of the journey. You can't skip from Friday to Sunday.

But Saturday doesn't last forever.

*Pause and consider: What version of yourself needs to die so your true self can emerge?*

## Stories of Death and Transformation

**Jesus in Gethsemane (Luke 22:39-46):**

In one of the most honest moments in spiritual literature, Jesus—facing death—prays with brutal vulnerability:

> "Father, if you are willing, take this cup from me; yet not my will, but yours be done."
>
> — Luke 22:42

This is crucial: Jesus didn't want to die. He didn't spiritualize it. Didn't pretend it was easy. He asked for another way. He sweat blood, begging for escape.

But then: "Yet not my will, but yours be done."

That's the death that changes everything. The death of His will. His preference. His desire to avoid pain. Surrendered to a larger reality, a deeper trust.

And because He died that death in the garden before He died the death on the cross, resurrection was possible.

**Paul's Testimony:**

Paul, in his letters, talks about dying constantly.

> "I face death daily—yes, just as surely as I boast about you."
>
> — 1 Corinthians 15:31 (adapted)

Every day, a death to self. Every day, a surrender.

> "I have been crucified and I no longer live the old way, but a new life lives in me. The life I now live in the body, I live by trust in what's Real, which loved me and gave itself for me."
>
> — Galatians 2:20 (adapted)

The old Paul is dead. Saul, the persecutor, is gone. A new creation lives.

> "But whatever were gains to me I now consider loss for the sake of what truly matters. What is more, I consider everything a loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing truth deeply, for whose sake I have lost all things. I consider them garbage, that I may gain what's real and be found in it, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from performance, but that which comes through trust—the wholeness that comes from reality on the basis of faith."
>
> — Philippians 3:7-9 (adapted)

Paul had to die to:
- His reputation (from respected religious leader to rejected outcast)
- His certainties (all his theological training had to be reconsidered)
- His control (shipwrecked, beaten, imprisoned)
- His plans (wanted to go to Spain, ended up in Rome—in chains)

But every death brought resurrection. Every loss brought gain. Every tomb preceded new life.

**The Grain of Wheat (John 12:24):**

> "Very truly I tell you, unless a kernel of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains only a single seed. But if it dies, it produces many seeds."
>
> — John 12:24

This principle explains everything: Death is how life multiplies.

A seed that stays a seed stays alone. Safe. Intact. Unchanging.

But also unfruitful.

A seed that falls, that dies, that's buried in dark soil—that seed becomes a plant. Then a stalk. Then a head of grain. Then many seeds.

One death. Much fruit.

What's the seed in your life that needs to fall and die? What are you clutching that needs to be buried so it can multiply?

---

## A Deeper Truth

> "I have been crucified and I no longer live, but a new life lives in me. The life I now live in the body, I live by trust in what loved me and gave itself for me."
>
> — Galatians 2:20 (adapted)

Unpack every phrase:
- **"I have been crucified"** - Something in you has already died. The old self, the false self, the self that's separated from reality—dead.
- **"I no longer live"** - The old you is gone. This isn't self-improvement. This is death and resurrection.
- **"But a new life lives in me"** - The resurrection. New life. Not self-generated. Life-generated.
- **"The life I now live in the body"** - Still human. Still here. Still embodied. But transformed.
- **"I live by trust in what loved me and gave itself for me"** - The foundation. Not your performance. Love itself. Radical sacrifice.

This kind of transformation isn't a once-for-all event that happens and never needs to happen again. The symbolic death in baptism, in therapy, in recovery, in spiritual awakening—all of these point to an ongoing reality we live out across our entire lives.

As we grow from childhood into adulthood, as we experience the complexities and harsh realities of life, we discover new layers of the false self that need to die. New illusions about reality that need to be shattered. New areas of control we must surrender.

The child who committed to change believed. The teenager questioned. The young adult faced new temptations. The adult confronted failure. The mature person learned to let go.

Each stage of life requires its own deaths, its own resurrections. We're not repeating the initial transformation—we're living into the fullness of what that transformation means, layer by layer, death by death, resurrection by resurrection.

---

## The Wayfarer Moment

**You can't be resurrected until you're willing to die. Transformation requires surrender of the self we've been protecting.**

This is the scariest wayfarer moment yet. Because death feels like loss. Like failure. Like the end.

But the wayfarer learns: Death is passage. The tomb isn't the end; it's the womb of new life. What feels like dying is actually being born.

Richard Rohr describes this transformative death:

> "We do not think ourselves into new ways of living, we live ourselves into new ways of thinking. The most courageous thing we will ever do is to bear humbly the mystery of our own reality. Your False Self is who you think you are. Your True Self is who you are in the deepest pattern of existence. The goal is to die before you die, so that when you finally do die, you've learned how to die. This dying isn't death, it's freedom."
>
> — Richard Rohr, *Falling Upward* (adapted)

I didn't want the old me to die. I liked him. He was successful. Respected. Put-together. Sure, he was exhausted and empty inside, but at least he looked good.

When reality started dismantling that version of me—taking away the platforms, the approval, the certainties—I fought. Hard. I was furious. I felt abandoned.

But slowly, painfully, I started to see: Life wasn't destroying me. It was liberating me. The old me was a prison. And love loved me too much to leave me there.

## Original Writing from the Blog

THUMP thump...THUMP thump...thump... thump...thum

I gasp for air
This is it
My last breath
As I exhale slowly

My eyelids close
My vision fades
Silence crashes into the room
Like rolling thunder

The walls melt
Like ice cream on a hot summer day

What is that noise?
What is that blinding light?
As the thin veil between this life and the next
Is split from top to bottom

Tick tock...Tick tock...tock...tock...toc

*Clock time stops now*

They're standing around me
Some busy
Some just watching

And some…
...aren't flesh and blood

Who are they?
These orbs of light
Floating around my bed
As if preparing me for flight
Seeing if I am dead?
Pulling me through the veil without a fight

*Eternal time is now*

"CLEAR!" ...&nbsp;BAMB!!!

My head jerks back
I'm thrust as if shot out of a canon
I'm traveling through a tunnel
Swirling flashes
Faster...faster...at the speed of light
I gasp for air
The veil is sealed once again

Where am I, now???

Some things cannot be unseen...
...unheard
...unfelt

And I will never be the same...because...

Almost dying changes nothing
Dying changes everything

---

## Song Integration

I wrote this piece trying to capture what it feels like when everything stops—when you're at the edge of life itself. The slowing heartbeat. The fading vision. The silence that crashes like thunder. I wanted to feel the moment when clock time—our measured existence—finally stops. The writing explores physical death—someone in crisis on the ER table, the thin veil between this world and the next, the transition into the spiritual realm.

But the song talks about a different kind of death entirely. A spiritual death. A death to self.

Here's the crucial theme: when we undergo transformation, that death must be complete. Total. The old self—the false self, the impostor, the performance-driven pretender—must fully die. Because if the old patterns are revived, nothing changes. Almost dying changes nothing. You return to the same brokenness, the same swamp.

Real transformation requires real death.

The last thing we want in our spiritual death is to revive the old patterns. That's the danger of partial surrender, of "almost dying." You go through the pain of dying without experiencing the transformation that comes from complete death. It's like CPR bringing someone back before the healing can happen—returning them to the same broken body, the same dying state.

The song captures this truth: "Almost dying changes nothing / Dying changes everything."

So while the prose explores the mystery of physical death and crossing the veil, the song confronts us with an even harder question: Are you willing to let the old self die completely? Are you willing to stay dead to that false self, even when revival of the old patterns feels easier than embracing the new life?

That's when "Dying Changes Everything" took its final shape. The heartbeat imagery became the song's pulse—the life force of the old self fading. The "tick tock" of time became the countdown to total surrender. And the silence that crashes became the moment when love's voice breaks through the death: "Child, you will be found."

The song needed to go where the prose couldn't—from dying to rising, yes, but more importantly, from incomplete death to complete transformation. From the waters of change closing over the old self to the breath of new life filling reborn lungs.

### Song: "Dying Changes Everything"

**Verse 1**
I'm sinking deep, the waters rising
Lost inside this broken place
Breathing in the weight of silence
Drowning in my own disgrace
My eyes grow dim, my strength is failing
Shadows closing all around
But in the stillness I hear whispers
"Child, you will be found"

**Pre-Chorus**
Tick tock… time fades out
Love breaks through the doubt

**Chorus**
Almost dying changes nothing
Dying changes everything
I release the chains I'm clutching
Now I rise on healing's wings
Spirit lifts me from the waters
Breath of heaven fills my lungs
In surrender I discover
New life rising with the sun

**Verse 2**
The veil is torn, the light is breaking
A timeless moment has come
Flames of mercy burn around me
Pulling me toward wholeness' throne
Grace like lightning strikes my spirit
Love restores my heart again
No more running, no more hiding
I am free, I'm found again

**Pre-Chorus**
Tick tock… time fades out
Love breaks through the doubt

**Chorus (Big)**
Almost dying changes nothing
Dying changes everything
I release the chains I'm clutching
Now I rise on healing's wings
Spirit lifts me from the waters
Breath of heaven fills my lungs
In surrender I discover
New life rising with the sun

**Bridge (Build)**
I have crossed from death to life
You're the fire, You're the light
Nothing stands but love divine
Dying changes everything
*(Repeat as needed, rising each time)*

**Verse 3**
Now I stand, my chains are broken
Every shadow swept away
Hope is rising, truth has spoken
Night has turned to brighter day
I will sing of resurrection
Testify to what love's done
From the grave into its glory
All my battles now are won

**Final Chorus / Tag**
Almost dying changes nothing
Dying changes everything
I am living in this presence
Breathing heaven's holy breath

**Outro (Soft, reflective)**
Heartbeat slows.
Tick… tock… time is gone
Eternal life has just begun
Love, You're my only song
Dying changed it all

## Reflections for the Road

These aren't homework. They're invitations. Gentle questions to help you engage with the deaths you're facing—or avoiding.

Take as much time as you need. Saturday can't be rushed. But it also can't be avoided.

### Questions for the Journey:

1. **What in you needs to die? Name it specifically.**

   Not in general terms. Not "my issues" or "my brokenness." What specifically needs to die?

   Maybe it's a relationship that's become toxic. Maybe it's a dream that's become an obsession. Maybe it's the version of yourself you've been clinging to—the capable one, the strong one, the one who has it all together.

   Maybe it's your need to be right. Your need to control. Your need to perform.

   Name it. Write it down. Look at it. Acknowledge: This has to die.

2. **What are you afraid of losing if it dies?**

   Be brutally honest. Death feels like loss because it is loss. What will you lose if this thing dies?

   Approval? Security? Identity? The future you planned? The person you thought you were?

   Name the fear. Don't minimize it. Don't spiritualize it. Just name it.

   Then ask: Is what I'm afraid of losing actually life? Or is it just familiar death?

3. **What's your Saturday? Where are you stuck between death and resurrection?**

   Maybe something has already died—a marriage, a career, a certainty, a self—and you're in the tomb. Between the death and whatever comes next.

   Saturday is disorienting. You can't go back to Friday (that life is dead). You can't see Sunday yet (transformation is still hidden). You're just... waiting.

   If you're in Saturday, name it. You're not stuck. You're in passage. The tomb is part of the journey.

4. **What would it look like to live as someone who's already let the old self die?**

   Imagine for a moment: What if the false self is already gone? What if the performance, the control, the fear—what if it's already dead?

   What would you let go of? What would you stop protecting? How would you live differently?

   You're not trying to kill what's already dead. You're learning to stop resuscitating it.

5. **What would resurrection look like for you?**

   Not going back to the old life. Not returning to what was. But being transformed into something new.

   You can't orchestrate resurrection. You can't force it. But you can imagine it. You can hope for it.

   What new life might be emerging from this death? What new self might be born from this tomb?

## Practice: The Burial Ritual

Find a quiet place. Somewhere you can be honest. Somewhere you can grieve.

Bring something that represents what needs to die. Maybe:
- An old journal from a season you're releasing
- A symbol of a role you've outgrown
- A picture of a dream you're surrendering
- An object that represents the false self you've been performing

Hold it. Look at it. Acknowledge it.

Thank reality for it, even. For what it was. For what it taught you. For how it protected you when you needed protection.

Then say out loud:

**"I'm letting this die. I'm releasing it. I'm surrendering it to what's Real."**

Pause. Breathe. Let yourself feel the weight of it.

Then speak this burial prayer:

**"I surrender this. I let it die. I trust reality to transform what's meant to live and to bury what's meant to stay dead. I trust that Saturday doesn't last forever. I trust that life is making all things new. Amen."**

If possible, literally bury the object. Or put it away somewhere you won't see it—a box in the closet, a drawer you don't open. A physical act of release.

You've named the death. You've released it. Now you wait. In the tomb. On Saturday.

But you're not alone. And Sunday is coming.

---

## Closing Image

The tomb. Silent. Dark. Waiting.

Saturday—the day between death and resurrection. The most honest place to be.

You've died. Or something in you has died. Or something needs to die and you're finally letting it.

And now you're here. In the dark. In the silence. In the waiting.

It doesn't feel like grace. It feels like loss. It feels like the end.

But here's what the tomb teaches: Death is not the end. It's passage.

There's a story of someone spending Saturday in the grave. Silent. Still. Hidden.

Those who loved him spent Saturday in despair, thinking it was over. Thinking Friday's death was final.

They didn't know Sunday was coming. They couldn't see resurrection from inside Saturday.

Neither can you.

But it's coming anyway.

The tomb is dark, but it's not empty. Love is there. In the silence. In the waiting. In the dying.

And love is the force that raises the dead.

So you wait. You grieve. You trust.

*Take a breath.*

You let what needs to die stay dead.

And you keep your face turned toward Sunday—toward transformation you can't yet see but believe is coming.

Because dying changes everything.

And Sunday always comes.
