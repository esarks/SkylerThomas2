 BOOK DESCRIPTION (Copy/Paste to KDP)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

What do you do when you find yourself in the swamp—stuck, struggling,
sinking?

Out of the Swamp: How I Found Truth is a raw, honest journey through
spiritual transformation. From the depths of struggle to the water's edge
of grace, and finally into the unforced rhythms of life with Jesus, this
book invites you into a story that might feel a lot like your own.

Through 14 chapters, 3 movements, and 14 original songs, Skyler Thomas
explores what it means to:
• Name your swamp and cry out honestly to God
• Experience the turning point of grace at the water's edge
• Learn to live in the unforced rhythms that come from walking with Jesus

This isn't a book about having all the answers. It's about learning to ask
better questions. It's about discovering that grace isn't just sufficient
—it's everything.

Each chapter includes:
- Personal narrative and theological reflection
- Biblical stories and core scriptures
- An original song with full lyrics
- Reflective questions for personal or group study
- Practical spiritual practices

Perfect for:
- Personal devotional reading
- Small group study
- Anyone feeling stuck in their spiritual journey
- Those exploring what grace-centered living really means
