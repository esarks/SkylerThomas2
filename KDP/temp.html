<p>To those still in the swamp, who haven’t yet heard the call.</p>
<p>To those at the water’s edge, learning what it means to be washed
clean.</p>
<p>And to those walking in unforced rhythms, discovering that grace is
not just sufficient— it’s everything.</p>
<p>This is your story too.</p>
<p>And most important, to my loving wife and children who didn’t leave
me when things got at their worst. You make life pure joy.</p>

<p><em>“I used to think love was something I earned. Then I met it in a
swamp. Covered in mud, gasping for air, convinced I was too far
gone—that’s when I felt it. Not a rescue that pulled me out immediately,
but a presence that sat with me in the muck and whispered, ‘I’m here.
I’ve been here the whole time. And I’m not leaving.’”</em></p>
<p>Now, I need to be honest with you about something: this is a book
about finding something more. And that “something more” is a spiritual
connection—but probably not the kind you’re thinking of.</p>
<p>This isn’t about religion. It’s not about joining a church or
converting to any particular faith tradition. But yes, I’m going to
introduce you to some faith-based authors. Yes, I’ll cite passages from
the Holy Bible. Because these ancient texts and thinkers have mapped
this journey before us, and their wisdom matters.</p>
<p>Here’s what this book IS about: introducing you to a God who created
you and loves you exactly where you are right now. Not where you should
be. Not where you wish you were. Right where you are.</p>
<p><strong>If you’ve never been to church</strong>, that’s okay. You
might actually have an advantage—fewer bad experiences to unlearn.</p>
<p><strong>If you walked away from church years ago</strong>, I get it.
I did too. The institution failed a lot of us. But this isn’t about
going back to what hurt you.</p>
<p><strong>If you’re not sure you even believe in God</strong>, stick
with me. I’m not asking you to sign a statement of faith. I’m inviting
you into a story—mine, and maybe yours—about what happens when you stop
pretending and start being honest.</p>
<p>Here’s the thing: I’m going to talk about God. About Jesus. About
finding something real in the middle of the mess.</p>
<p>But I’m not going to ask you to believe it all right now. I’m just
asking you to consider: <em>What if there’s a Love that meets you
exactly where you are? What if you don’t have to clean yourself up
first? What if the brokenness you’re carrying is the exact place where
healing begins?</em></p>
<p><strong>This is what I mean by “spirituality” instead of
“religion”:</strong></p>
<p>Religion says: Follow the rules, perform well, measure up, and maybe
you’ll be acceptable.</p>
<p>Spirituality says: You’re already known. Already seen. Already loved.
Now come find out what that means.</p>
<p>I talk about <strong>God</strong> not as some distant cosmic force or
angry judge, but as the source of the love you’ve been searching for
your whole life. The kind of love that doesn’t depend on your
performance. That doesn’t quit when you mess up. That runs toward you,
not away from you.</p>
<p>I talk about <strong>Jesus</strong> not as a religious figure on a
stained-glass window, but as God choosing to step into human skin. To
live our life. To feel our pain. To show us what Love looks like with
hands and feet. He didn’t come to start a religion. He came for people
who were drowning—people like you and me.</p>
<p>I talk about <strong>the Spirit</strong> not as some spooky religious
concept, but as the presence of God that can actually live in you. That
whispers truth when you’re believing lies. That gives you strength when
you have none left. That transforms you from the inside out.</p>
<p><strong>Why would any of this matter to you?</strong></p>
<p>Because maybe you’ve tried everything else.</p>
<p>Maybe you’ve tried achieving your way to meaning. Working harder.
Making more money. Finding the right relationship. Filling the void with
whatever you could find. Maybe you’ve even tried to just be a better
person through morality (whatever that is). And if you’re honest, it’s
all come up short.</p>
<p>Not because you’re doing it wrong. But because you were designed for
something deeper. Something that doesn’t break when life breaks.
Something that doesn’t end when your heart stops.</p>
<p>An old theologian named Augustine said it like this: <em>“Our hearts
are restless until they rest in You.”</em></p>
<p>That restlessness you feel? That ache for more? That’s not a flaw.
That’s your soul telling you there’s something real to find.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what I’m NOT doing:</strong></p>
<p>I’m not trying to get you to join a church (though finding a good
community later might help).</p>
<p>I’m not asking you to become religious (please don’t).</p>
<p>I’m not going to quote a bunch of Bible verses at you like
proof-texts (though I will tell you some ancient stories that might
surprise you).</p>
<p><strong>Here’s what I AM doing:</strong></p>
<p>I’m inviting you to consider that the God you might have given up on
never gave up on you.</p>
<p>I’m showing you what it looked like when I stopped running and
started being honest.</p>
<p>I’m suggesting that the swamp you’re in might be the exact place
where you finally meet Love.</p>
<p><strong>If you’re thinking:</strong> <em>“I don’t know if I buy any
of this God stuff…”</em></p>
<p>Good. Questions are allowed here. Doubt is part of the journey. You
don’t have to have it all figured out to keep reading.</p>
<p><strong>If you’re thinking:</strong> <em>“I’ve been hurt by religious
people…”</em></p>
<p>I’m sorry. Truly. The system fails people all the time. Hypocrites
are real. Church can wound. But please don’t confuse the failure of
religious people with who God actually is.</p>
<p><strong>If you’re thinking:</strong> <em>“Why should I give this a
try?”</em></p>
<p>Because you picked up this book for a reason. Something in you is
still searching. Still hoping. Still wondering if there might be
more.</p>
<p>And I’m here to tell you: I believe there is.</p>
<p>Not religion. Not performance. Not rules.</p>
<p>But a Love that wades into your swamp.</p>
<p>A grace that meets you exactly where you are.</p>
<p>A Life that doesn’t end when this one does.</p>
<p><strong>This book is for the messy, the broken, the burned-out, the
skeptical, the searching.</strong></p>
<p>It’s for people who know they don’t have it all together and are
tired of pretending otherwise.</p>
<p>If that’s you, keep reading.</p>
<p>Let’s walk together.</p>
<h2 id="the-crisis-and-the-promise">The Crisis and the Promise</h2>
<p>It was more than burnout. It was a moral breakdown—an unraveling of
the life I’d tried to hold together. My performance-based identity
collapsed. I crossed boundaries those closest to me couldn’t accept. As
a leader, husband, and father, I lost the trust that defined my
identity.</p>
<p>What remained? Shame. Emptiness. And the desperate hope that I could
still be loved.</p>
<p>But here’s what I discovered:</p>
<p>Love meets us exactly where we are. Not where we should be. Not where
we pretend to be. Exactly where we are—mud and all.</p>
<h2 id="the-journey-metaphor-three-movements">The Journey Metaphor:
Three Movements</h2>
<p>So where does this journey take us?</p>
<p>This book follows three movements—three stages of the journey from
performance to authenticity, from drowning to dancing, from the swamp to
the unforced rhythms of life.</p>
<h3 id="movement-1-the-swamp">Movement 1: The Swamp</h3>
<p>This is where we’re stuck. The quicksand of shame. The muck of
failure. The waters of despair rising.</p>
<p>Dark water you can’t see through. The smell of rot. Heavy silence.
Muck that clings and pulls. Everything exhausting.</p>
<p>This isn’t just depression (though it might include that). This isn’t
just spiritual dryness (though that’s part of it).</p>
<p>This is the accumulated weight of years of performing instead of
being. Conversations that felt hollow. Service that felt like work.
Community that felt like critique. Meaning that became a burden instead
of a gift.</p>
<p>An ancient writer knew this place:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Save me, O God, for the floodwaters are up to my neck. Deeper
and deeper I sink into the mire; I can’t find a foothold. I am in deep
water, and the floods overwhelm me. I am exhausted from crying for help;
my throat is parched. My eyes are swollen with weeping, waiting for my
God to help me.”</em></p>
<p>— Psalm 69:1-3 (NLT)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Worn out calling for help.</p>
<p>That’s the swamp.</p>
<p><em>Pause and consider: Have you ever felt this way? That sinking
feeling, the exhaustion of trying to keep it all together?</em></p>
<p>Why spend so many chapters talking about the swamp?</p>
<p>Because it isn’t a niche struggle—it’s epidemic. The swamp shows up
everywhere. In the writings of thinkers across centuries. Because it is
the universal human condition.</p>
<p>It’s so common that many never even stop to name it. For some, it
becomes the assumed backdrop of life: heavy, stagnant, normal. Others
rationalize it, assuming that true depth requires long seasons of
despair.</p>
<p>And candidly? There are millions who don’t even realize life doesn’t
have to be this way. They’ve made peace with the swamp because they’ve
never glimpsed the possibility of another kind of life.</p>
<p>That’s why it matters to pause here.</p>
<p>Because until we name the swamp for what it is, we can’t imagine
leaving it.</p>
<h3 id="movement-2-the-waters-edge">Movement 2: The Water’s Edge</h3>
<p>The transition space.</p>
<p>You’ve dragged yourself (or been dragged) out of the swamp. Now
you’re at the edge of something clean, something clear. Living water.
The kind that refreshes. That quenches real thirst. That becomes a
spring within you.</p>
<p>But you’re terrified to step in.</p>
<p>Why? Because you’re filthy. Covered in swamp muck. Reeking of failure
and shame. You’re convinced the water will reject you. That you need to
clean up first before you can approach.</p>
<p>This is where love does its most subversive work.</p>
<p>Where you discover that the invitation isn’t “Clean yourself up and
then come.”</p>
<p>It’s “Come as you are, and restoration will find you.”</p>
<p>An ancient letter put it this way: <em>“But because of great love for
us, the Source of all mercy made us alive even when we were dead in our
broken patterns—it is by radical kindness you have been saved.”</em></p>
<p>Even when we were dead. Even when we were in the swamp.</p>
<p>That’s when healing came.</p>
<h3 id="movement-3-unforced-rhythms-of-life">Movement 3: Unforced
Rhythms of Life</h3>
<p>Life after surrender.</p>
<p>Not perfection, but participation. Not arrival, but walking.</p>
<p>There’s an ancient invitation that speaks to this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“Come to me, all of you who are weary and carry heavy burdens,
and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you. Let me teach you,
because I am humble and gentle at heart, and you will find rest for your
souls. For my yoke is easy to bear, and the burden I give you is
light.”</em></p>
<p>— Matthew 11:28-30 (NLT)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unforced rhythms—that’s what this final movement is about.</p>
<p>Picture someone who’s learned to swim—or better yet, learned to
float. Still in the water, but no longer fighting it. No longer
exhausting yourself trying to stay afloat through sheer effort. Learning
to rest in the water that holds you.</p>
<p>One spiritual teacher captured the essence of what the world needs
most:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The greatest issue facing the world today, with all its
heartbreaking needs, is whether those who, by profession or culture, are
identified as ‘people of Christ’ will become disciples—students,
apprentices, practitioners—of Jesus Christ, steadily learning from him
how to live the life of the Kingdom of the Heavens into every corner of
human existence.”</p>
<p>— Dallas Willard, <em>The Great Omission</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The unforced rhythms are about becoming apprentices—not of a
religious system, but of a way of life. Learning to live sustainably,
authentically, in the flow of grace rather than the grind of
performance.</p>
<h2 id="the-songs-as-spiritual-markers">The Songs as Spiritual
Markers</h2>
<p>Each chapter centers on a song.</p>
<p>These aren’t illustrations of the teaching—they’re the heart of it.
Each song was written in a specific season, in a specific struggle, and
became a waypoint on the journey. The book is the story behind the
songs. The songs are the soundtrack of healing.</p>
<p>When you reach each chapter, I’ll invite you to listen first, read
second. Let the music do what music does—bypass your defenses and touch
the ache directly. Then we’ll unpack it together.</p>
<p>The ancient Psalms taught me this. They’re not theological treatises
set to music. They’re prayers that became songs. Laments that became
worship. Honest cries that became sacred text.</p>
<p>David didn’t write about crying out in the cave. He cried out, and
that cry became a psalm.</p>
<p>These fourteen songs are my psalms: imperfect, incomplete, but
honest.</p>
<p>And honesty is where healing begins.</p>
<p>Here’s the scandalous truth that changes everything:</p>
<p><strong>Love doesn’t wait for you to clean up. It wades into the muck
with you.</strong></p>
<p>And here’s the scandal: it calls that muck ‘holy ground.’ Because
anywhere you finally meet your true self IS holy ground—swamp mud and
all.</p>
<p>Remember the ancient story of Moses at the burning bush? The voice
said, <em>“Take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing
is holy ground.”</em></p>
<p>Moses was standing in the wilderness. Tending sheep. Running from his
past. Not in a temple. Not in a place of worship. In the wilderness.</p>
<p>And the voice said: This is holy ground.</p>
<p>The swamp becomes holy ground when you meet truth there.</p>
<p>Not because the swamp is good. But because honesty enters it. And
wherever honesty is becomes sacred.</p>
<p>An ancient truth captures this: <em>“Love shows itself in this: While
we were still broken, restoration came for us.”</em></p>
<p>While we were still.</p>
<p>Not after we cleaned up. Not once we got our act together. Not when
we finally believed hard enough.</p>
<p><strong>While we were still.</strong></p>
<p>In the swamp. In the muck. In the middle of our mess.</p>
<h2 id="closing-image-the-traveler-at-the-trailhead">Closing Image: The
Traveler at the Trailhead</h2>
<p>Picture a traveler at the beginning of a long road.</p>
<p>Pack on their back. Mud on their boots. Questions in their
hearts.</p>
<p>They don’t know exactly where the road leads. They don’t know how
long it will take. They don’t know what they’ll encounter along the
way.</p>
<p>But they know two things:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>They can’t stay in the swamp.</li>
<li>They don’t have to walk alone.</li>
</ol>
<p>An ancient seeker, reflecting on his own journey from the swamp to
wholeness, wrote these now-famous words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“You have made us for yourself, O Lord, and our hearts are restless
until they rest in you.”</p>
<p>— Augustine of Hippo, <em>Confessions</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That restlessness is mercy.</p>
<p>It’s your soul refusing to settle for substitutes, calling you out of
the swamp and onto the road.</p>
<p>So we begin.</p>
<p>Not with answers, but with honesty. Not with arrival, but with
willingness to walk.</p>
<p>The journey is long.</p>
<p>But love is real.</p>
<p>And the Wayfarer’s Anthem is this: <strong>I can’t do this alone. But
I don’t have to.</strong></p>
<p>Let’s walk together.</p>

(The Struggle)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“Love is closest to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed
in spirit.”</p>
<p>— Ancient wisdom</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The swamp is where honesty begins.</p>
<p>For too long, we’ve been taught that strength means pretending
everything is fine. That integrity means wearing our best face and
smiling through the pain. That acceptance is for people who’ve cleaned
themselves up just enough to deserve it.</p>
<p>The swamp says: no more.</p>
<p>The swamp is where we finally stop performing. Where we sink to our
knees in the muck and admit: I’m not okay. I’m not strong. I’m not sure
I even know what I believe anymore. I’m drowning, and I don’t know how
to save myself.</p>
<p>And here’s the mystery: this is exactly where healing meets us.</p>
<p>Not in the polished conference room. Not in the perfectly curated
social media post. Not in the moment we finally get our act
together.</p>
<p>Love meets us in the swamp.</p>
<p>The ancient people knew the swamp—generations of oppression and
bondage. David knew it—hiding in caves, running from enemies, writing
poems of lament. Job knew it—loss, broken body, friends who offered
platitudes instead of presence. Jonah knew it—literal fish belly,
running from truth, discovering that you can’t outrun what’s real.</p>
<p>The swamp is not the enemy. The swamp is where pretending dies so
that truth can live.</p>
<p><strong>The Journey Through the Swamp:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Chapter 1: My Swamp</strong> - You recognize where you are.
Stuck. Sinking. No longer able to pretend you’re okay. This is the
moment of brutal honesty: naming the swamp for what it is.</p>
<p><a

Will Rise</a></p>
<p><strong>Chapter 2: But Then I Prayed</strong> - In your desperation,
you cry out. Not eloquent words—raw, honest, desperate words. And you
discover that honest conversation with yourself, with the universe, with
whatever you call the Divine—that’s the language of authentic
relationship.</p>

Then I Prayed</a></p>
<p><strong>Chapter 3: STOP!!! And Make a Decision</strong> - You reach
the crossroads. You can’t stay in the swamp forever. Healing is offered,
but it must be received. You have to choose: the swamp or the water’s
edge.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 4: Dying Changes Everything</strong> - Something has
to die. The false self. The illusions. The control. Death feels like the
end, but it’s actually the beginning. Before resurrection, there must be
a tomb.</p>

<h2 id="entering-this-movement">Entering This Movement</h2>
<p>Before you begin these four chapters, take a moment to prepare
yourself. This isn’t light reading. This is soul work.</p>
<p><strong>Where is your swamp?</strong></p>
<p>Not the metaphorical, theoretical swamp. Your actual swamp. The place
where you’re stuck right now. The situation that’s draining you. The
pattern you can’t break. The shame you can’t shake. The failure you
can’t escape.</p>
<p>Name it. Be specific. Don’t soften it. Don’t spiritualize it yet.</p>
<p>This is…</p>
<p><strong>What are you afraid to admit?</strong></p>
<p>What truth have you been avoiding? What weakness have you been
hiding? What need have you been denying?</p>
<p>If you could be completely honest—with yourself, with God, with one
other person—what would you say?</p>
<p>Practice saying it out loud right now. Even if it’s just a whisper:
“I’m not okay.”</p>
<p><strong>What would it cost you to get honest?</strong></p>
<p>Would you have to drop the mask? Disappoint someone? Admit you need
help? Let go of control?</p>
<p>The swamp requires honesty. And honesty requires courage.</p>
<p>Are you ready?</p>
<p><strong>One more thing:</strong></p>
<p>You don’t have to be strong to enter the swamp. You just have to be
honest.</p>
<p>You don’t have to have faith figured out. You just have to be willing
to cry out.</p>
<p>You don’t have to know how this ends. You just have to take the next
step.</p>
<p>So take a breath. Steady yourself. And step into the honesty that
healing requires.</p>
<p>The swamp is waiting. But so is grace.</p>
<p><em>When you’re ready, turn to Chapter 1: My Swamp.</em></p>

How I Found Truth (Chapter 1)</h1>
<h3 id="movement-1-in-the-swamp-the-struggle-2">MOVEMENT 1: IN THE SWAMP
(The Struggle)</h3>
<h3 id="chapter-1-my-swamp">Chapter 1: My Swamp</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“You have made us for yourself, O Lord, and our hearts are restless
until they rest in you.” — Augustine, <em>Confessions</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Before you read this chapter, I want you to know
something.</strong></p>
<p>If you’re still reading, you’re already curious. Maybe skeptical, but
curious. That’s enough.</p>
<p>This chapter is going to talk about the swamp—that stuck place where
you’ve been living, maybe for years. It’s going to name some hard
truths. It’s going to introduce you to some people who’ve been there and
some ancient wisdom that speaks to it.</p>
<p>And at the end, I’m going to ask you to consider something. Just
consider it—not commit to it, not sign up for anything. Just open your
mind to a possibility you might not have thought about before.</p>
<p>A possibility that the stirring you feel, the restlessness, the
longing—might be more than random. Might be something, or Someone,
calling to you.</p>
<p>You don’t have to believe it yet. You don’t have to understand it
all. You just have to keep reading.</p>
<p>Can you do that?</p>
<p>You know you’re in the swamp when you start defending it.</p>
<p>When someone asks if you’re okay and you snap back, “I’m fine.” When
a friend gently suggests you might need help and you list all the
reasons why your situation is different, more complicated, not what it
looks like from the outside. When you catch yourself explaining why you
have to stay—why leaving isn’t an option, why this is just how life is,
why everyone else simply doesn’t understand.</p>
<p>The swamp doesn’t announce itself with a sign. It’s not marked on any
map. You don’t wake up one day and think, “Ah yes, I’ve arrived at my
personal hell.” It creeps in. A compromise here. A numbing behavior
there. A toxic relationship you’ve learned to navigate. A performance
you maintain because it’s easier than being honest. A shame you carry
that’s become so familiar you can’t imagine living without its
weight.</p>
<p>And here’s what makes the swamp so dangerous: you get functional in
it. You learn to breathe the toxic air. You figure out where to step to
avoid sinking deeper. You develop a routine, a rhythm, a way of existing
that looks normal from the outside while you’re dying on the inside.</p>
<p>This chapter is about the moment you stop defending and start seeing.
When the explanations fall away and you’re left with the raw truth: this
place was never meant to sustain life. And you can’t keep pretending it
does.</p>
<p>The writing that follows came from my moment of seeing. Not in a
flash of revelation, but in a slow, painful recognition that I’d built a
life in a place that was killing me. And the first step toward freedom
wasn’t a grand gesture—it was simply admitting the truth: This is my
swamp. And I’m drowning in it.</p>
<h2 id="stories-of-the-swamp">Stories of the Swamp</h2>
<p>Want to know something interesting? This swamp thing isn’t new.
People have been stuck in swamps for thousands of years. And some of
their stories might sound familiar.</p>
<p><strong>The Ancient Captives</strong></p>
<p>There’s a story about a group of people stuck for four hundred years.
Generational swamp. They couldn’t free themselves.</p>
<p>So they groaned. They cried out.</p>
<p>And the response?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I have certainly seen the oppression of my people in Egypt. I have
heard their cries of distress because of their harsh slave drivers. Yes,
I am aware of their suffering. So I have come down to rescue them from
the power of the Egyptians…”</p>
<p>— Exodus 3:7-8 (NLT)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not “try harder.” Not “fix yourself first.”</p>
<p><em>I have come down to help them.</em></p>
<p><strong>The Man in the Fish</strong></p>
<p>Then there’s this wild story about a guy in the ultimate
swamp—literally inside a fish.</p>
<p>From that impossible place, he prays:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I cried out to the LORD in my great trouble, and he answered me. I
called to you from the land of the dead, and LORD, you heard me!… Those
who worship false gods turn their backs on all God’s mercies. But I will
offer sacrifices to you with songs of praise, and I will fulfill all my
vows. For my salvation comes from the LORD alone.”</p>
<p>— Jonah 2:2, 8-9 (NLT)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even from inside a fish, he names what he’d been doing: “clinging to
worthless idols.”</p>
<p>The swamp is where you discover that everything you’ve been clinging
to is worthless. Every substitute. Every prop. Every false
salvation.</p>
<p><strong>The Fugitive in the Cave</strong></p>
<p>And there’s the fugitive hiding in a cave, writing this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I cry out to the LORD; I plead for the LORD’s mercy. I pour out my
complaints before him and tell him all my troubles… I look for someone
to come and help me, but no one gives me a passing thought! No one will
help me; no one cares a bit what happens to me.”</p>
<p>— Psalm 142:1-2, 4 (NLT)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He doesn’t clean up his prayer. Doesn’t spiritualize his pain.
Doesn’t pretend.</p>
<p>That honesty—that raw vulnerability—IS courage. The complaint IS the
prayer.</p>
<h2 id="the-wayfarer-moment">The Wayfarer Moment</h2>
<p><strong>Admitting “I’m not okay” is the doorway to healing. The swamp
is where pretending goes to die.</strong></p>
<p>For years, I’d been pretending. Performing. Image-maintaining. And it
was soul-crushing. Exhausting. Unsustainable.</p>
<p>The swamp strips away performance. When you’re drowning, you stop
caring about optics. You just want oxygen.</p>
<p>And that’s exactly where healing begins.</p>
<p>The ancient poet modeled this vulnerability, written from a cave
where he was hiding for his life. Brutally honest. Vulnerable. No
pretending. No performance. He names isolation, abandonment,
desperation.</p>
<p>The swamp forces vulnerability. You can’t maintain the image anymore.
You can’t perform. You can’t pretend.</p>
<p>It feels like death.</p>
<p>But it’s actually courage.</p>
<p>This is how you become truly known. And only the truly known can be
truly loved.</p>
<p>That admission—that raw honesty—isn’t defeat.</p>
<p>It’s the doorway.</p>
<h2 id="song-integration">Song Integration</h2>
<p>“I Will Rise” belongs in this chapter because it captures the
theological heart of what it means to move from swamp to freedom: this
is not self-rescue, but God-dependent hope. The song expresses the
paradox at the center of spiritual transformation—we are utterly
powerless to save ourselves, yet called to actively respond to
grace.</p>
<p>The opening verse names the impostor self with unflinching honesty:
<em>“I built these walls, I learned to fight, kept my heart locked up so
tight… But I’ve been sinking all the while.”</em> This is the lament of
someone who has maintained appearances while drowning inside. The song
begins where transformation always begins—in truthful self-assessment,
not pretense. Like the psalms of lament, it refuses to sugarcoat
reality. God meets us in our honesty, not in our performance.</p>
<p>But the pre-chorus reveals where hope actually comes from: <em>“You
pull me close, You draw me higher, out of the swamp, into the
fire.”</em> The agency belongs to God. We rise because we are lifted. We
escape because we are drawn. This is cooperative grace—God initiating
what only God can do, while we respond with the step we must take. The
progression from swamp to fire is significant: we’re not moving from
pain to comfort, but from one kind of pain (the slow death of the swamp)
to another (the purifying fire that burns away the false self and forges
the true one).</p>
<p>The chorus functions as prophetic declaration, not positive thinking:
<em>“I won’t stay where shadows grow, where my heart turns cold, where
the dark winds blow.”</em> The song doesn’t deny present reality; it
refuses to accept it as permanent. This echoes Psalm 40’s pattern of
lament turning toward trust: “He lifted me out of the pit of despair,
out of the mud and the mire.” Rising is God’s character, His pattern,
His promise.</p>
<p>The bridge captures the Wayfarer Moment—the vulnerable decision to
move even while trembling: <em>“I see the road, I see the dawn, and
though I shake, I’ll carry on. No more hiding, no more chains, Your
grace is stronger than my pain.”</em> Here is biblical faith: not the
absence of fear, but trust in God’s character despite fear. “No more
hiding” means the death of the impostor, and the foundation for this
vulnerability is grace—“stronger than my pain.” Not my strength, not my
willpower, but unearned love that pursues us into the swamp and refuses
to leave us there.</p>
<p>The song functions as both prayer and testimony. As prayer, it’s a
cry for help acknowledging both desperation and hope. As testimony, it
declares for others still stuck: “I am rising—not by my power but by
grace—and so can you.” The chapter teaches that restlessness is mercy,
the soul refusing to settle for substitutes. “I Will Rise” is that
restlessness set to music, the refusal to accept the swamp as home.</p>
<p>The chapter ends with a whispered prayer: “Help.” The song is the
elaboration of that prayer—help me rise, help me trust, help me believe
the swamp isn’t the end of my story. This is the faith that saves: not
perfect understanding or unwavering confidence, but the broken cry “I
will rise,” spoken to the God who has already promised, “I will lift you
out.”</p>
<h2 id="key-takeaways">Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Honesty is the doorway to healing.</strong> You can’t heal
what you won’t name. Stop defending the swamp and start seeing it for
what it truly is—a place of disconnection and slow death.</li>
<li><strong>Performance exhausts; authenticity frees.</strong> The
impostor self keeps you trapped in endless striving. Grace meets you as
you are, not as you pretend to be.</li>
<li><strong>Your restlessness is a mercy.</strong> The deep thirst you
feel isn’t a flaw—it’s your soul refusing to settle for substitutes and
pointing you toward the living water you actually need.</li>
<li><strong>Powerlessness is the prerequisite for grace.</strong> God
doesn’t wait for you to clean up or prove yourself worthy. He reaches
into the muck while you’re still broken and says, “Come as you
are.”</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="practice-the-five-minute-honest-conversation">Practice: The
Five-Minute Honest Conversation</h2>
<p>Find a quiet space. Set a timer for five minutes.</p>
<p>And just be honest. Out loud if possible. In writing if necessary. In
prayer if that’s your language. In conversation with yourself if
not.</p>
<p>Don’t edit yourself. Don’t soften it. Don’t try to make it sound
better. Just be honest.</p>
<p>Talk about the swamp. How long you’ve been there. What it feels like.
What you’re angry about, confused about, afraid of.</p>
<p>Talk about the performance. The exhaustion. The isolation. The
shame.</p>
<p>Say “Help.”</p>
<p>When the timer goes off, breathe.</p>
<p><em>Take a breath.</em></p>
<p><strong>Time needed:</strong> 5 minutes</p>
<p><strong>Tip for starting small:</strong> If 5 minutes of unfiltered
honesty feels too long or overwhelming, start with just 2 minutes. Or if
speaking out loud feels too vulnerable, write your honest thoughts in a
journal instead. The goal is honesty, not eloquence or a specific
format. Some people find it easier to be honest in writing first, then
build up to speaking their truth aloud.</p>
<p>You’ve just spoken the most important truth: the real one.</p>
<p>The universe hears. Not because it was eloquent. Because it was true.
And truth is the language healing speaks.</p>

<h3 id="chapter-2-but-then-i-prayed">Chapter 2: But Then I Prayed</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“I cry aloud to the LORD; I lift up my voice to the LORD for mercy.”
— Psalm 142:1</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>An Invitation to Consider</strong></p>
<p>Before we dig into this chapter, I want you to consider
something.</p>
<p>What if that stirring in the middle of the night isn’t just anxiety
or restlessness?</p>
<p>What if the God of the Universe—the God who created you—has been
calling to you? Not with demands. Not with conditions. Just calling.</p>
<p>Wanting to hear from you. Wanting to speak to you.</p>
<p>I’m not asking you to believe everything right now. I’m not asking
you to commit to a religion or join a church or sign a statement of
faith.</p>
<p>I’m just asking you to consider: what if He’s there? What if He’s
been there all along, waiting for you to turn toward Him?</p>
<p>You don’t need a huge performance prayer. No religious jargon. No
fancy words.</p>
<p>Just a simple prayer. Something like this:</p>
<p><em>“Yes, God. I want to listen to You. I want to consider what You
may have to offer me from my swamp.”</em></p>
<p>That’s it. That’s enough.</p>
<p>Because the God who created you doesn’t need your eloquence. He just
wants your honesty.</p>
<p>He doesn’t need your strength. He just wants your willingness.</p>
<p>He doesn’t need your certainty. He just wants you to crack the door
open and say, “I’m listening.”</p>
<p>What if that’s all it takes? What if the turning point—the “but then
I prayed” moment—is simply saying yes to the possibility that Someone is
calling your name?</p>
<p>Can you do that? Can you just consider it?</p>
<p>Here’s the pattern most of us follow when life falls apart:</p>
<p>First, we try to fix it ourselves. We strategize, problem-solve, work
harder. We’re competent—we’ve handled crises before.</p>
<p>When that doesn’t work, we try to manage it. We numb the pain, stay
busy, medicate with work (or substances), Netflix, food,
scrolling—whatever keeps the darkness at bay.</p>
<p>When that stops working, we start bargaining. <em>If I just… If they
would… If this changes…</em> Desperate negotiations from a position of
no power.</p>
<p>And finally—only finally—when we’ve exhausted every other option,
when we’re flat on our backs with nothing left, we reach out. Not the
polished words we learned growing up, but the raw, honest cries that are
barely more than groans: “Help.”</p>
<p>This chapter is about that moment. When self-sufficiency collapses.
When all our strategies fail. When we run out of moves and discover that
running out of moves was the point all along.</p>
<p>Because reaching out isn’t the last resort when everything else
fails. It’s the first reality we keep trying to avoid: we need help more
than we need solutions.</p>
<p>The writing that follows came from a season when I learned to speak
honestly instead of performing politely. When “But then I prayed” became
the turning point in every valley I walked through.</p>
<p>Prayer—conversation with the Divine, with your deepest self, with
what’s Real—in the swamp doesn’t look like prayer on the mountaintop (or
in a flashy church setting). Mountaintop prayer is full of gratitude and
joy, hands raised, voice strong. Swamp prayer is different.</p>
<p>Swamp prayer is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Groaning when words won’t come: “And the Holy Spirit helps us in our
weakness. For example, we don’t know what God wants us to pray for. But
the Holy Spirit prays for us with groanings that cannot be expressed in
words” (Romans 8:26, NLT)</li>
<li>Crying out instead of composing: “I cry out to the LORD; I plead for
the LORD’s mercy” (Psalm 142:1, NLT)</li>
<li>Complaining honestly instead of pretending piously: “O LORD, how
long will you forget me? Forever? How long will you look the other way?”
(Psalm 13:1, NLT)</li>
<li>Questioning reality instead of defending platitudes: “LORD, why do
the wicked prosper? Why are evil people so happy?” (Jeremiah 12:1,
NLT)</li>
</ul>
<p>In the swamp, you learn that honest conversation isn’t about saying
the right things. It’s about saying the real things.</p>
<p>Henri Nouwen reflects on the prodigal son:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The prodigal son’s confession—‘Father, I have sinned’—came not from
a place of spiritual maturity but from the pigpen, from desperation,
from coming to his senses in the midst of ruin.”</p>
<p>— Henri Nouwen, <em>The Return of the Prodigal Son</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is swamp prayer: painfully, uncomfortably, refreshingly
honest.</p>
<p>No spiritual jargon. No performance. No pretending everything’s fine
when it’s not. Just raw human beings crying out from the depths of their
need.</p>
<p>And here’s the scandalous truth: this kind of honesty is what healing
prefers. Because honest conversation—even angry, doubting, or
desperate—is still connection. Performance is isolation.</p>
<h2 id="stories-of-prayer">Stories of Prayer</h2>
<p>Throughout history, the most powerful prayers have come from the most
desperate places.</p>
<p><strong>Moses in Crisis (Exodus 32:11-13, NLT)</strong></p>
<p>Moses is on the mountain receiving the Law—forty days and nights in
God’s presence, tablets being written by the finger of God Himself. But
down below, the people have grown impatient. They’ve melted their gold
jewelry and cast an idol, a golden calf, and are dancing around it,
worshiping it.</p>
<p>God sees it. And His anger burns hot.</p>
<p>“I have seen these people,” God tells Moses, “and they are a
stiff-necked people. Now leave me alone so that my anger may burn
against them and that I may destroy them.”</p>
<p>Moses is standing before the living God, hearing a divine sentence of
destruction pronounced on an entire nation. The people he led out of
Egypt. The people he’s been shepherding through the wilderness. They’re
about to be annihilated.</p>
<p>This is the moment Moses could have stepped back, let God’s justice
fall, maybe even started over with a new people descended from him
alone. But instead, Moses steps forward. And he prays—not safe, not
polished, not deferential.</p>
<p>He argues with God. Reminds God of His promises. Intercedes
desperately:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“But Moses tried to pacify the LORD his God. ‘O LORD!’ he said. ‘Why
are you so angry with your own people, whom you brought from the land of
Egypt with such great power and such a strong hand?’”</p>
<p>— Exodus 32:11 (NLT)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Moses prays honestly, boldly, desperately. He appeals to God’s
reputation, God’s promises, God’s character. And incredibly—God listens.
God relents. The prayer changes the outcome.</p>
<p><strong>The Tax Collector’s Prayer (Luke 18:13, NLT)</strong></p>
<p>Jesus tells a parable about two men who went up to the temple to
pray. Picture the scene: the grand temple courts, people gathered for
prayer, the religious elite visible and vocal.</p>
<p>The first man, a Pharisee, stands prominently where people can see
him. His prayer is a performance: “God, I thank you that I am not like
other people—robbers, evildoers, adulterers—or even like this tax
collector. I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I get.”</p>
<p>Everything about his prayer screams confidence. He’s listing his
resume. Comparing himself favorably to others. Standing tall.</p>
<p>The second man is a tax collector—a collaborator with Rome, a traitor
to his own people, a man who’s gotten rich by exploiting others. He
knows what people think of him. He knows what he thinks of himself.</p>
<p>He stands at a distance. Not up front. Not visible. Back in the
shadows where people like him belong.</p>
<p>He can’t even lift his eyes to heaven. Head down. Shoulders slumped.
And he beats his chest—an outward sign of inward anguish—as he prays the
only prayer he has left:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“But the tax collector stood at a distance and dared not even lift
his eyes to heaven as he prayed. Instead, he beat his chest in sorrow,
saying, ‘O God, be merciful to me, for I am a sinner.’”</p>
<p>— Luke 18:13 (NLT)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No resume. No comparisons. No religious credentials. Just raw,
desperate honesty: I’m a sinner. Have mercy.</p>
<p>Jesus’ verdict? The tax collector—the desperate one, the honest one,
the one who brought nothing but need—went home justified. The Pharisee
didn’t.</p>
<p><strong>Historical Prayers from the Swamp</strong></p>
<p><strong>Augustine of Hippo (354-430 AD)</strong> spent years
wrestling with his own brokenness—sexual addiction, intellectual pride,
spiritual confusion. Even after his conversion, he looked at the
wreckage of his inner life and knew he couldn’t fix it himself. So he
prayed with brutal honesty:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The house of my soul is too narrow for you to come to it. May it be
enlarged by you. It is in ruins: restore it.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the prayer of someone who’s stopped pretending the house is
in good shape. Someone who’s looked at the ruins and said: I can’t fix
this. But maybe You can.</p>
<p><strong>Martin Luther (1483-1546)</strong> battled depression so
severe he sometimes couldn’t get out of bed. The spiritual anguish was
crushing—doubts, despair, a sense of God’s absence. In one of his
darkest moments, he wrote this prayer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I am dust and ashes and full of sin… I have no other refuge or
comfort than your dear Son Jesus Christ.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not theological precision. Not spiritual victory. Just desperate
clinging to the only hope he had left: Jesus.</p>
<p>These weren’t prayers from mountaintops. They were prayers from
swamps, prisons, depressions, doubts, and desperation. Prayers that
brought the real mess, the actual ruins, the honest brokenness before
God.</p>
<p>And every single one was heard.</p>
<h2 id="song-integration-1">Song Integration</h2>
<p>“But Then I Prayed” captures the theological truth at the heart of
this chapter: prayer is not religious performance but radical
vulnerability before God. The phrase “but then” functions as the hinge
between two realities—our powerlessness and God’s presence. This is not
a magical formula but a relational turning point, the moment when we
stop bearing our burdens alone and invite Presence into our panic.</p>
<p>The chapter teaches that honest prayer trumps perfect prayer, and
this song embodies what that honesty sounds like. The opening verse
names the spiritual warfare of the swamp: <em>“The night was long, the
weight was strong, the shadows whispered, ‘You don’t belong.’”</em>
These whispers aren’t merely self-doubt but the voice of the accuser. To
name this darkness in prayer is to drag it into the light where its
power diminishes. Like Psalm 22’s “My God, my God, why have you
abandoned me?”—this is honest anguish without apology.</p>
<p>The pre-chorus reveals the scandal of grace: <em>“And in my sorrow,
in my despair, I found Your presence waiting there.”</em> God doesn’t
wait for us to clean up before drawing near. Psalm 34:18 promises He is
“close to the brokenhearted,” which means we find God’s presence not
despite our despair but within it. Love meets us in the muck, not after
we’ve escaped it.</p>
<p>The chorus testifies to how presence changes the equation: <em>“But
then I prayed, and You were near, Your voice of love cast out my
fear.”</em> This doesn’t claim circumstances changed instantly, but that
experience shifted radically. “Your voice of love cast out my fear”
echoes 1 John 4:18—perfect love driving out fear. This is encounter with
the living God, not self-talk. When we experience God’s love as personal
reality, fear loses its tyranny. We’re still in the swamp, but we’re not
alone in it.</p>
<p>“Your mercy came, Your grace remained” captures both the immediate
and the ongoing. Mercy comes in crisis moments; grace remains through
the long haul. The “chains were gone—You healed my pain” speaks to
spiritual and relational healing—the chains of isolation, shame, and
pretense breaking. The pain of bearing burdens alone being lifted. This
healing is profound even when outer circumstances remain difficult.</p>
<p>The song follows the biblical lament pattern: honest complaint,
desperate plea, wrestling, and eventual surrender. But it’s not
linear—it’s the messy, cyclical reality of faith under pressure. The
willingness to ask “why?” without rushing to easy answers models what
the chapter teaches: God can handle our questions. He prefers honest
wrestling to polished performance.</p>
<p>The repeated refrain “But then I prayed” creates a spiritual
practice, training our hearts to run to God in crisis as our first
response, not our last resort. Each verse presents a new challenge; each
time the response is the same: turn toward God. The song ends with
commitment to ongoing relationship: “So I will pray through every fight,
I’ll lift my song in darkest night.” This is the realism of mature
faith—the swamp may not disappear immediately, but the pattern is
established. When darkness comes, we turn toward Light.</p>
<p>This song serves transformation because it demonstrates the prayer
the chapter describes: groaning, crying out, questioning honestly—all
while maintaining the thread of faith. Not faith that circumstances will
change according to our preferences, but faith that God is present,
listening, love itself. This is the prayer that changes everything—not
because it manipulates God but because it positions us where
transformation happens: in the presence, in the honesty, in the
relationship that was always available.</p>
<h2 id="key-takeaways-1">Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Honest prayer trumps perfect prayer.</strong> God doesn’t
need your eloquence—He wants your reality. Raw, messy, doubting prayers
connect more deeply than polished performances.</li>
<li><strong>Lament is a legitimate form of prayer.</strong> Bringing
your pain, anger, and confusion directly before God without sugarcoating
is biblical faith, not lack of faith.</li>
<li><strong>Prayer is surrender, not strategy.</strong> Stop trying to
manipulate outcomes and start yielding to a larger reality. “Not my
will, but Yours” is the prayer that changes everything.</li>
<li><strong>Presence changes the equation.</strong> When you cry out,
you discover you’re not alone in the swamp. God doesn’t always remove
the trial immediately, but He never leaves you to face it alone.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="practice-simple-prayer">Practice: Simple Prayer</h2>
<p>Richard Foster calls it “Simple Prayer”—bringing your ordinary
concerns to a loving presence without facade, without pretending to be
holy, without concealing true feelings.</p>
<p>Here’s how to practice it this week:</p>
<p><strong>Daily (5-10 minutes):</strong></p>
<p>Each morning or evening, sit in a quiet place. No special posture
required. No religious language necessary. Just you and honesty.</p>
<p>Say out loud (or write down) these three things:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>“This is where I am…”</strong> - Name your actual state. Not
where you should be. Where you ARE.
<ul>
<li><em>“I’m exhausted.”</em></li>
<li><em>“I’m angry at You.”</em></li>
<li><em>“I don’t know if I believe anymore.”</em></li>
<li><em>“I’m terrified about [specific thing].”</em></li>
<li><em>“I feel nothing.”</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>“This is what I need…”</strong> - Ask honestly. No
spiritualizing. What do you actually need?
<ul>
<li><em>“I need this situation to change.”</em></li>
<li><em>“I need to feel something besides numb.”</em></li>
<li><em>“I need help with my daughter.”</em></li>
<li><em>“I need to know You’re real.”</em></li>
<li><em>“I need rest.”</em></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>“I’m willing to…”</strong> - What are you willing to do?
Even if it’s small.
<ul>
<li><em>“I’m willing to show up tomorrow and try again.”</em></li>
<li><em>“I’m willing to be honest instead of hiding.”</em></li>
<li><em>“I’m willing to ask for help.”</em></li>
<li><em>“I’m willing to keep talking to You even though I’m
angry.”</em></li>
<li><em>“I’m willing to trust You with this one thing.”</em></li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<p>That’s it. No closing formula required. No “amen” if it doesn’t feel
right. Just honest conversation.</p>
<p><strong>This Week:</strong></p>
<p>Try this practice for 7 days. Keep it simple. Keep it honest. Don’t
perform. Don’t pretend.</p>
<p>At the end of the week, notice: - Did anything shift? - Did honesty
feel different from religious performance? - Did you sense anything—even
faintly—listening?</p>
<p>Remember: You’re not trying to pray “correctly.” You’re learning to
bring your real self instead of your edited self. That’s swamp prayer.
And it’s the kind that gets heard.</p>

<h3 id="chapter-3-stop-and-make-a-decision">Chapter 3: STOP!! And Make a
Decision</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“I have set before you life and death, blessings and curses. Now
choose life, so that you and your children may live.” — Deuteronomy
30:19</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>An Invitation to Consider</strong></p>
<p>You’ve named the swamp. You’ve considered that God might be
calling.</p>
<p>Maybe you even whispered that prayer: <em>“Yes, God. I want to
listen.”</em></p>
<p>But now comes the harder part. The decision part.</p>
<p>What if I told you that even your doubt can be part of the prayer?
What if you could say to God:</p>
<p><em>“God, I’m not sure I believe all this. Help me with my unbelief.
I’m ready to start listening to Your advice for my life. I want to leave
this swamp, but I don’t know how. Help me. I’m opening myself up to
making a decision to continue this journey of discovery.”</em></p>
<p>That’s enough. That’s honest. That’s real.</p>
<p>You don’t have to have it all figured out. You don’t have to believe
everything perfectly. You just have to be willing to take the next
step.</p>
<p>To pray—even if it’s just “Help.”</p>
<p>To listen—even if you’re not sure you’ll hear anything.</p>
<p>To decide—to continue this journey of discovery, wherever it
leads.</p>
<p>Can you accept the possibility that God can help you even in your
unbelief? That He can lead you out of the swamp even when you’re not
sure He’s real?</p>
<p>Because here’s the truth: He doesn’t need your certainty. He just
needs your willingness to take one step.</p>
<p>Keep reading. And be ready to decide.</p>
<h2 id="key-themes">Key Themes</h2>
<h3 id="the-paralysis-of-neutrality">1. The Paralysis of Neutrality</h3>
<p>We tell ourselves not deciding is safe middle ground. We can wait.
Observe. Keep our options open.</p>
<p>C.S. Lewis dismantles the illusion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Christianity, if false, is of no importance, and if true, of
infinite importance. The only thing it cannot be is moderately
important.”</p>
<p>— C.S. Lewis, <em>God in the Dock</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lewis forces the issue: you can’t stay neutral about what matters
most. Either Truth (with a capital T) is real, or it isn’t. Either you
choose toward it, or you choose away from it.</p>
<p>Middle ground doesn’t exist.</p>
<p>Same with the swamp. You can’t stay indefinitely between drowning and
swimming. Every day you don’t choose to leave is a day you’ve chosen to
stay.</p>
<p>Neutrality is a myth. Just another word for “status quo.”</p>
<p>Even Dante recognized this in his <em>Inferno</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“These wretches, who were never truly alive… are mixed with that
cowardly crew of angels… Heaven drove them out to keep its beauty from
being marred; and the depths of Hell will not receive them.”</p>
<p>— Dante Alighieri, <em>Inferno</em>, Canto III</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The uncommitted, those who refused to choose, were rejected by both
heaven and hell. They belonged nowhere because they stood for
nothing.</p>
<p>Not deciding is still deciding. The question is: what are you
deciding for?</p>
<p>God doesn’t want your indecision. Your hedging. Your “let me think
about it.”</p>
<p>He wants you. All of you. Now.</p>
<p>Not because He’s demanding. Because He’s desperate for you to
live.</p>
<h3 id="the-cost-of-comfort">2. The Cost of Comfort</h3>
<p>Dallas Willard exposes why we resist decision-making:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The cautious faith that never saws off the limb on which it is
sitting never learns that unattached limbs may find strange,
unaccountable ways of not falling… The issue is not really one of risk.
It is the issue of to whom we will risk ourselves… The greatest
challenge you and I face today is not whether we can believe, but
whether we can trust. Trust requires action. It requires that we stop
merely wishing and start walking.”</p>
<p>— Dallas Willard, <em>The Divine Conspiracy</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Willard names our fear: we’re not scared of making the wrong choice.
We’re scared of making any choice that requires letting go of control.
We’d rather sit on the limb than saw it off and discover we’ll be
caught.</p>
<p>The swamp feels safer than the water because it’s familiar. We know
this pain. We’ve adapted to this misery. Leaving means risking the
unknown—and that terrifies us more than slow death.</p>
<p>But Willard says: trust requires action. You can’t trust
theoretically. You have to actually step. Move. Choose.</p>
<p>Only in the choosing do you discover that reality “can be counted
on.”</p>
<p>The cost of comfort reveals why we resist making decisions in the
first place. But when we finally do decide, we discover something
profound: the decision itself is an act of faith.</p>
<h3 id="decision-as-act-of-faith">3. Decision as Act of Faith</h3>
<p>Brennan Manning reframes decision-making as fundamentally
spiritual:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“My deepest awareness of myself is that I am deeply loved by Jesus
Christ and I have done nothing to earn it or deserve it.”</p>
<p>— Brennan Manning, <em>The Ragamuffin Gospel</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Define yourself radically as one beloved. This is the true self.
Every other identity is illusion.</p>
<p>When we stop pretending and start living as beloved, we make choices
from a different foundation. We no longer choose based on fear of
rejection or need for approval. We choose based on who we already are:
loved, accepted, enough.</p>
<p>The decision to trust—to step out of the swamp and toward the
water—is the ultimate act of faith. It says, ‘I believe I’m loved. I
believe something good wants good for me. I believe there’s a better
way.’</p>
<p>Manning shifts the question from “What should I do?” to “Who am
I?”</p>
<p>If your identity is “beloved,” the decision becomes natural. You
choose healing not because you’ve earned it, but because you’re already
worthy of it. You step toward the water not to prove yourself, but
because you trust what’s calling you.</p>
<p>The swamp keeps you stuck in the old identity: performer, failure,
impostor.</p>
<p>The decision to leave is the decision to accept your true identity:
beloved.</p>
<p><em>What if you’re already loved, already enough, already
worthy—right now, in the swamp?</em></p>
<p>When we make the decision to trust—to step toward the water—we
discover that the real transformation isn’t about acquiring something
new. It’s about releasing what we’ve been clinging to.</p>
<h3 id="the-freedom-of-letting-go">4. The Freedom of Letting Go</h3>
<p>Richard Rohr, in <em>Falling Upward</em>, describes what happens when
we finally choose surrender:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“True transformation happens not by acquiring something new, but by
letting go of something old. The first half of life is about building
the container; the second half is about filling it with actual
contents—or, more commonly, emptying ourselves of the false
contents.”</p>
<p>— Richard Rohr, <em>Falling Upward</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your greatest spiritual teachers are your failures. They break open
the containers you spent the first half of life building. And in that
brokenness, you discover what you actually need isn’t more success, more
control, more certainty—it’s the freedom to be loved as you are.</p>
<p>The decision to stop, to make a choice, is often the decision to let
go. Not to acquire. Not to achieve. But to release your grip on the
swamp and trust that the water will hold you.</p>
<p>Transformation happens through subtraction, not addition. You don’t
need more willpower. More strategy. More options.</p>
<p>You need to let go.</p>
<p>The decision this chapter proposes isn’t “work harder.” It’s “release
your grip.”</p>
<p>Stop clinging to the swamp. Stop protecting yourself. Stop
maintaining the false self.</p>
<p>Let go—and discover what you’ve been afraid of losing was never yours
to keep.</p>
<h3 id="the-two-paths">5. The Two Paths</h3>
<p>The road turns into a “Y” here. And you must choose.</p>
<p>This isn’t a decision you can make gradually. You can’t ease into it.
You can’t half-commit and see how it feels. The swamp or the water’s
edge. Staying or leaving. The false self or the real.</p>
<p>You’re standing at the fork, and paralysis is just a slow yes to the
swamp.</p>
<p>An ancient story captures this choice perfectly:</p>
<p><strong>The Crossroads</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Now listen! Today I am giving you a choice between life and death,
between prosperity and disaster… Today I have given you the choice
between life and death, between blessings and curses. Now I call on
heaven and earth to witness the choice you make. Oh, that you would
choose life, so that you and your descendants might live!”</p>
<p>— Deuteronomy 30:15, 19 (NLT)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Choose life. Not because it’s easy. Because it’s real.</p>
<p>The choice isn’t complicated. It’s just hard.</p>
<p>Forward or back. Life or death. Water or swamp.</p>
<p>The only question is: will you move?</p>
<h2 id="the-wayfarer-moment-1">The Wayfarer Moment</h2>
<p><strong>The decision to leave the swamp is terrifying—not because you
don’t know what to do, but because you do.</strong></p>
<p>For me, the hardest part wasn’t figuring out the right choice. It was
admitting I’d been making the wrong one.</p>
<p>For years.</p>
<p>The swamp wasn’t happening to me. I was choosing it. Every day I
stayed, I chose it again.</p>
<p>That’s the brutal honesty this chapter ponders: you’re not a victim
of the swamp. You’re its tenant. And eviction requires your
signature.</p>
<p>Viktor Frankl, who survived Auschwitz, wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our
power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our
freedom.”</p>
<p>— Viktor Frankl, <em>Man’s Search for Meaning</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That space—that moment between the swamp and the decision—that’s
where freedom lives.</p>
<p>You can’t control what happened to you. Can’t control the
circumstances that led to the swamp. Can’t control other people’s
choices that contributed to your pain.</p>
<p>But you can control what you do next.</p>
<p>That’s your power. That’s your freedom.</p>
<p>And no one—not your past, not your circumstances, not your fears—can
take that from you.</p>
<h2 id="lyrics-stopdecide-the-rap">Lyrics: Stop/Decide (The Rap)</h2>
<p><strong>(Intro)</strong> Yo, I’m trapped in the noise, I’m lost in my
mind, Skeletons creeping, they’re crossing the line. Doubts keep
spinning, I’m running in place, But I hear Your voice calling, cutting
through the haze.</p>
<p><strong>(Verse 1)</strong> I can’t fake it, no, I can’t shake it, The
pain in my chest, I just can’t take it. Voices screaming, got me stuck
in my head, Skeletons dancing where the angels once tread.</p>
<p>What’s sleek? What’s weak? Who’s real? Who’s fake? I’m drowning in
the questions I can’t seem to shake. I’m shouting to the sky, “God, show
me the way, I’m tired of the chaos; I’m begging You today.”</p>
<p><strong>(Hook)</strong> STOP! Gotta make a decision, Your voice
breaks through with a crystal vision. The fear fades out, now I see
You’re near, All I gotta do is turn and let You steer.</p>
<p><strong>(Verse 2)</strong> You said, “Lay it down, I’ll carry the
weight, Let Me take your struggle, it’s never too late.” Step by step,
yeah, I’m walking the light, The chains fall off as I step in the
fight.</p>
<p>The lies I believed, now they crumble and fall, Your love lifts me
higher, breaking through it all. I was lost in my shame, but You called
my name, Now I’m running toward You, never the same.</p>
<p><strong>(Hook)</strong> STOP! Gotta make a decision, Your voice
breaks through with a crystal vision. The fear fades out, now I see
You’re near, All I gotta do is turn and let You steer.</p>
<p><strong>(Bridge)</strong> Grace, grace, it’s greater than sin, It
pulls me from the darkness I was living within. Hell on Earth? That’s
the weight of my shame, But Heaven is Your love, now I’m praising Your
name.</p>
<p>You whispered to me, “Give me your pain, I’ll take what’s broken and
make you whole again.” Eternal peace, yeah, it’s all that I need, So I
follow Your voice, let it take the lead.</p>
<p><strong>(Chorus)</strong> Grace, grace, God’s grace, Pulling me out
of my darkest place. Grace, grace, it’s a holy embrace, Now I’m running
with Your love, set a brand-new pace.</p>
<p><strong>(Outro)</strong> So I STOP, and I make the decision, To
follow Your path, walk the perfect vision. The shame is gone, my heart
feels new, I’m stepping in faith, God, I’m trusting in You.</p>

<h2 id="closing-image">Closing Image</h2>
<p>A foot raised. A breath held. The moment before the step.</p>
<p>The swamp is behind you. Familiar. Known. Safe in its misery.</p>
<p>The water’s edge is ahead. Unknown. Uncertain. Terrifying in its
promise.</p>
<p>And you stand at the crossroads.</p>
<p>This is the moment where everything pivots. Not when you arrive at
the destination. Not when the transformation is complete. Right here. In
the choosing.</p>
<p>For a moment, everything is suspended. You could go back. You could
change your mind. You could tell yourself “maybe later” or “not yet” or
“I’m not ready.”</p>
<p>The swamp whispers its temptations: <em>At least you know what to
expect here. At least you’ve learned to survive. At least it’s
familiar.</em></p>
<p>The water whispers its invitation: <em>There’s cleansing here.
There’s life here. There’s something more than survival.</em></p>
<p>And you—you’re caught between comfort and calling.</p>
<p>But you don’t go back.</p>
<p>You take a breath. You feel your heart pounding. You acknowledge the
fear—real fear, legitimate fear—and you choose anyway.</p>
<p><em>Take a breath.</em></p>
<p>And then: movement.</p>
<p>One foot forward. Then the other.</p>
<p>Not running. Not confident. Not sure this is the right choice. Just
moving.</p>
<p>Toward the water.</p>
<p>You’ve chosen. And now you walk.</p>
<p>Each step is a decision. Each step is an act of trust. Each step
says: <em>I believe there’s something better than where I’ve been, even
if I can’t yet see where I’m going.</em></p>
<p>The swamp is behind you. The water’s edge is ahead.</p>
<p>And you—with trembling legs and racing heart and a courage you didn’t
know you possessed—you’re a wayfarer now.</p>
<p>Not because you’re fearless.</p>
<p>Because you moved anyway.</p>
<p>Move.</p>

<p><strong>An Invitation to Consider</strong></p>
<p>You’ve named the swamp. You’ve prayed—even if it was just “Help.”
You’ve made a decision to keep walking this journey.</p>
<p>But here’s what nobody tells you at the beginning: deciding to leave
the swamp means something in you has to die.</p>
<p>Not physically. But the version of you that’s been surviving in the
muck. The coping mechanisms you’ve relied on. The false self you’ve
performed being. The illusions about how life works.</p>
<p>Those have to go.</p>
<p>And that feels terrifying. It feels like loss. Like defeat. Like the
end.</p>
<p>But what if it’s not the end? What if it’s the beginning?</p>
<p>This chapter is about death—but not the kind you need fear, though it
might be difficult. It’s about the death that leads to life. The kind of
dying that makes space for something new to grow.</p>
<p>I’m not going to sugarcoat it: this part is hard. Really hard.</p>
<p>But I want you to know something before you read further: on the
other side of this death is resurrection. On the other side of letting
go is freedom. On the other side of the tomb is new life.</p>
<p>You don’t have to understand it all right now. You just have to keep
reading. Keep walking. Keep trusting that the path leads somewhere
good.</p>
<p>Can you do that?</p>
<p>Before we go further, let’s pray together. A simple prayer, but an
honest one—for the journey that may come.</p>
<p><em>“God, I’m scared of what has to die in me. I’m scared of letting
go. But I’m also tired of living the way I’ve been living. If there’s
new life on the other side of this death, I want it. Help me trust You
through this. Help me let go of what needs to go. Help me believe that
You’re leading me somewhere good. I’m willing to keep walking, even when
I don’t understand. Amen.”</em></p>
<h2 id="key-themes-1">Key Themes</h2>
<h3 id="death-as-transformation">1. Death as Transformation</h3>
<p>Death in spiritual literature is rarely just biological cessation.
It’s transformation. Passage. Transition.</p>
<p>Here are the different kinds of death we experience: - Death to the
false self - the person we’ve performed being, not who we actually are -
Death to illusions - the stories we’ve told ourselves about how life
should work - Death to control - the grip we’ve held on outcomes, other
people, our futures - Death to the life we planned so we can live the
life that’s actually here</p>
<p>Dallas Willard says that transformation requires this kind of
death:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The greatest issue facing the world today, with all its
heartbreaking needs, is whether those who, by profession or culture, are
identified as ‘Christians’ will become disciples – students,
apprentices, practitioners – of Jesus Christ, steadily learning from him
how to live the life of the Kingdom of the Heavens into every corner of
human existence.”</p>
<p>— Dallas Willard, <em>The Great Omission</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The death of my performance, the good and the bad, felt like the
death of myself. I’d poured everything into it—my identity, my worth, my
purpose. When it crumbled under the weight of my own moral failure, I
didn’t know who I was. Would I lose my family? Would I lose my job?
Would I lose my purpose?</p>
<p>My moral decay didn’t just end a chapter of my life. It severed me
from the community I’d grown so close to. The people who knew me,
trusted me, looked to me—gone. Not because they abandoned me, but
because my choices had consequences. Real, devastating, life-altering
consequences. And greater, it threatened my marriage.</p>
<p>I remember the night I finally admitted it was over. The community
I’d built. The reputation I’d cultivated. The leader I’d pretended to
be.</p>
<p>All of it—dead.</p>
<p>But here’s what I didn’t understand then: God wasn’t destroying me
out of anger. Life was dismantling the false version of me I’d built.
Killing the performer who wore my success like a costume. Killing my
addiction to approval, to respect, to being seen as the “good” one.</p>
<p>The false self had to die so the true self could begin to live.</p>
<p>But what exactly has to die? What is it that transformation requires
us to release? The answer is painful but freeing: the false self we’ve
been performing has to go.</p>
<h3 id="the-death-of-the-false-self">2. The Death of the False Self</h3>
<p>The false self is the person you’ve been pretending to be. The mask
you wear. The performance you give. The image you maintain. Richard Rohr
contrasts the true self (the person you were created to be, your
authentic essence) with the false self (the person you think you need to
be to survive, to be loved, to matter).</p>
<p>The false self is who we think we are—our mental self-image and
social agreement, which most people spend their whole lives living up to
or down to. It is all a fictional creation. The true self is who we
objectively are from the beginning, in the deepest pattern of our
being.</p>
<p>Richard Rohr writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“There is nothing to prove and nothing to protect. I am who I am and
it’s enough.”</p>
<p>— Richard Rohr, <em>Immortal Diamond</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The false self is built on: - What people expect - What earns
approval - What feels safe - What maintains control</p>
<p>The false self says: - “If people knew the real me, they’d reject me”
- “I have to perform to be loved” - “Vulnerability is weakness” - “I am
what I accomplish”</p>
<p>Thomas Merton understood this deeply:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Every one of us is shadowed by an illusory person: a false self.
This is the man I want myself to be but who cannot exist, because God
does not know anything about him. And to be unknown of God is altogether
too much privacy.”</p>
<p>— Thomas Merton, <em>New Seeds of Contemplation</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The death of the false self is terrifying because it feels like
losing yourself.</p>
<p>But you’re not losing yourself. You’re losing the prison you’ve been
living in.</p>

<h3 id="dying-to-control-certainty-performance">3. Dying to Control,
Certainty, Performance</h3>
<p>Control is one of the hardest things to surrender. We want to manage
outcomes. Predict futures. Protect ourselves from pain.</p>
<p>Certainty is another. We want answers, not mysteries. Clear paths,
not ambiguity. Solid ground, not shifting sand.</p>
<p>Performance is how we try to earn what life offers freely:
acceptance, love, belonging.</p>
<p>All three have to die.</p>
<p><strong>Dying to Control:</strong></p>
<p>The death of control feels like freefall.</p>
<p>But it’s not. It’s falling into the arms of what’s been holding you
all along—the reality that you were never actually in control, and
that’s okay.</p>
<p>The spiritual life can only be real when it is lived in the midst of
the pains and joys of the here and now. All things—a glass of water, a
walk in the woods, a chair, a table—are spiritual. To live a spiritual
life means to fully claim our daily existence, right here in the
freefall.</p>
<p><strong>Dying to Certainty:</strong></p>
<p>This is hard for many of us because we’ve been taught doubt is
weakness.</p>
<p>But actually, clinging to certainty is the opposite of faith. Real
trust requires living in the midst of mystery.</p>
<p>The death of false certainty opens space for a bigger, truer
understanding of reality.</p>
<p><strong>Dying to Performance:</strong></p>
<p>You can’t earn love. You can’t perform your way to acceptance. Every
effort to prove yourself is just another attempt at self-justification
that exhausts your soul.</p>
<p>Brennan Manning exposed this trap:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“My deepest awareness of myself is that I am deeply loved by Jesus
Christ and I have done nothing to earn it or deserve it.”</p>
<p>— Brennan Manning, <em>The Ragamuffin Gospel</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The impostor is the false self shaped by others’ expectations. The
death of the impostor is the beginning of life. We don’t have to be
smart, successful, or accomplished enough. We simply have to be
real.</p>
<p>The death of performance means you stop. You rest. You receive. You
let yourself be loved not because you’re impressive, but because you’re
human.</p>
<p>Letting go of control, certainty, and performance creates space for
something new. But there’s a space between the death and the new life—a
tomb we must enter before resurrection can come.</p>
<h3 id="why-resurrection-requires-a-tomb">4. Why Resurrection Requires a
Tomb</h3>
<p>You can’t be raised unless you’ve died. You can’t experience
transformation unless you’ve been in the darkness.</p>
<p>Between death and resurrection, there’s a tomb. Dark. Silent.
Seemingly final. And most of us are terrified of that in-between
space.</p>
<p>We want instant transformation: decision one moment, new life the
next. We want to skip the tomb. But there’s no resurrection without
burial.</p>
<p>C.S. Lewis understood this paradox of death and life:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The principle runs through all life from top to bottom. Give up your
self, and you will find your real self. Lose your life and you will save
it. Submit to death, death of your ambitions and favourite wishes every
day and death of your whole body in the end: submit with every fibre of
your being, and you will find eternal life. Keep back nothing. Nothing
that you have not given away will ever be really yours. Nothing in you
that has not died will ever be raised from the dead. Look for yourself,
and you will find in the long run only hatred, loneliness, despair,
rage, ruin, and decay. But look for Christ and you will find Him, and
with Him everything else thrown in.”</p>
<p>— C.S. Lewis, <em>Mere Christianity</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the hardest part: living in the tomb. You’ve let the old self
die. The false identity is gone. The illusions are shattered. The
performance has stopped.</p>
<p>But the new self hasn’t emerged yet. You’re in the darkness, waiting.
And you don’t know how long the darkness will last.</p>
<p>Most of us experience transformation this way: We’ve experienced
death—of dreams, relationships, certainties, selves—and we’re waiting in
the tomb. We know about resurrection theoretically, but we’re living in
the tomb emotionally.</p>
<p>The darkness is part of the journey. You can’t skip it. You can’t
rush it. You have to go through it.</p>
<p>But here’s the promise: the tomb is not the end. It never was. It’s
the passage between who you were and who you’re becoming.</p>
<p><em>What version of yourself needs to die so your true self can
emerge?</em></p>
<h2 id="a-deeper-truth">A Deeper Truth</h2>
<p>All these stories—from Elizabeth Lesser to Jesus to Paul to Brené
Brown—point to the same reality: transformation requires death. Not
metaphorical “letting go” or positive thinking. Actual death of
something that’s been alive in you.</p>
<p>By now, you should be convinced that the God who created you has been
calling you into a better way of living. That the voice you’re hearing
isn’t just some made-up fantasy in your head.</p>
<p>You’ve named the swamp. You’ve prayed. Have you decided to keep
taking the journey?</p>
<p>The question isn’t whether you believe the spiritual language. The
question is: <strong>Are you ready to let the old version of you die so
the real you can live?</strong></p>
<p>An ancient writer named Paul captured this in Galatians 2:20. Whether
you take this literally or metaphorically, here’s what it means for
anyone in the swamp:</p>
<p>Unpack every phrase: - <strong>“My old self has been crucified with
Christ”</strong> - Something in you has already died. The old self, the
false self, the ego-driven self—crucified. - <strong>“It is no longer I
who live”</strong> - The old you is no longer running the show. This
isn’t self-improvement. This is death and resurrection. - <strong>“But
Christ lives in me”</strong> - The resurrection. New life. Not
self-generated. Christ-generated. - <strong>“So I live in this earthly
body”</strong> - Still human. Still here. Still embodied. But the source
has changed. - <strong>“By trusting in the Son of God, who loved me and
gave himself for me”</strong> - The foundation. Not your performance.
Love itself. Radical sacrifice.</p>
<p>This kind of transformation isn’t a once-for-all event that happens
and never needs to happen again. The symbolic death in baptism, in
therapy, in recovery, in spiritual awakening—all of these point to an
ongoing reality we live out across our entire lives.</p>
<p>As we grow from childhood into adulthood, as we experience the
complexities and harsh realities of life, we discover new layers of the
false self that need to die. New illusions about reality that need to be
shattered. New areas of control we must surrender.</p>
<p>The child who committed to change believed. The teenager questioned.
The young adult faced new temptations. The adult confronted failure. The
mature person learned to let go.</p>
<p>Each stage of life requires its own deaths, its own resurrections.
We’re not repeating the initial transformation—we’re living into the
fullness of what that transformation means, layer by layer, death by
death, resurrection by resurrection.</p>
<h2 id="song-integration-2">Song Integration</h2>
<p>“Dying Changes Everything” confronts us with the most paradoxical
truth in spiritual transformation: we must die to live, lose ourselves
to find ourselves, descend into the tomb before experiencing
resurrection. The chapter teaches that transformation requires actual
death of the false self, and the song gives voice to this terrifying yet
liberating reality.</p>
<p>The chorus—<em>“Almost dying changes nothing, dying changes
everything”</em>—crystallizes the chapter’s core teaching. This
distinction is theologically crucial. Almost dying is flirtation with
transformation without commitment. It’s touching the edge of surrender
but pulling back, acknowledging what needs to die but refusing to let it
actually expire. And as the song declares, this changes nothing. The
chapter illustrates this through multiple frameworks: the death of the
false self, the death of control, the death of performance-based
identity. In each case, partial death is insufficient. The song’s
insistence on complete death echoes Paul’s radical statement in
Galatians 2:20: “I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer
live.” Not “I’m working on dying.” Not “I’m mostly dead.” But “I no
longer live.” This is total death, and only this kind makes resurrection
possible.</p>
<p>The opening verse—<em>“I’m sinking deep, the waters rising, lost
inside this broken place”</em>—evokes baptismal theology. Romans 6:3-4
teaches that baptism represents being buried with Christ in death so we
might rise with Him in new life. The waters that feel like drowning are
actually the waters of transformation. They close over the old self
completely, suffocating what was, creating space for what will be.
“Drowning in my own disgrace” names the spiritual reality precipitating
this death—not some abstract false self but the actual mess we’ve made,
the patterns we’ve established, the shame we’ve accumulated. But the
whisper—<em>“Child, you will be found”</em>—reveals this as mercy. God
enters the waters with us, guides us through the death, promises
discovery on the other side.</p>
<p>The theological tension is profound: we must go under completely
(full immersion, total death) while trusting Love will not let us stay
under (resurrection is promised). We want to keep one foot on solid
ground, one part protected from dying. But the song insists: complete
submersion or no transformation.</p>
<p>The chorus continues: <em>“I release the chains I’m clutching, now I
rise on healing’s wings.”</em> This sequence matters theologically.
Release precedes rising. We don’t rise by our own power; we rise because
we’ve finally stopped clutching the chains anchoring us to the swamp, to
the false self. The chains we clutch are paradoxically both bondage and
false security—familiar even as they kill us. The chapter teaches
through Richard Rohr that transformation happens through subtraction,
not addition. The song embodies this: “I release” is the action required
of us. “Now I rise” is what grace does in response. “Spirit lifts me
from the waters, breath of heaven fills my lungs” invokes Genesis
2:7—new creation theology. We’re not being resuscitated to our old life
but breathed into existence as new creations.</p>
<p>Verse two—<em>“The veil is torn, the light is
breaking”</em>—references Jesus’ death when the temple veil tore
(Matthew 27:51), symbolizing direct access to God’s presence. In our
death to self, the veil between false identity and true identity is
torn. “Flames of mercy burn around me” connects to the refiner’s fire
from Malachi 3:2-3—not punishment but purification, burning away what is
false while preserving what is true.</p>
<p>“No more running, no more hiding, I am free, I’m found again” speaks
to the death of the impostor. The false self runs and hides, maintains
performance, protects the image. But in complete death, this exhausting
pattern finally ends. We stop running because there’s nothing left to
protect. We stop hiding because we’ve been fully seen and are still
loved.</p>
<p>This song serves as Movement One’s climax because it names the
hardest truth: transformation requires death—actual death of who we
thought we were, what we thought we needed, how we thought life worked.
And on the other side of that death, in the tomb, in the Saturday
waiting, resurrection begins. The song doesn’t rush past the tomb but
honors the complete submersion, the staying dead to what needs to stay
dead. Yet it also refuses to leave us there. “Dying changes everything”
because death is not the end—it’s passage, transformation, the doorway
to life we couldn’t access any other way.</p>

<p>Maybe it’s your need to be right. Your need to control. Your need to
perform.</p>
<p>Name it. Write it down. Look at it. Acknowledge: This has to
die.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>What are you afraid of losing if it dies?</strong></p>
<p>Be brutally honest. Death feels like loss because it is loss. What
will you lose if this thing dies?</p>
<p>Approval? Security? Identity? The future you planned? The person you
thought you were?</p>
<p>Name the fear. Don’t minimize it. Don’t spiritualize it. Just name
it.</p>
<p>Then ask: Is what I’m afraid of losing actually life? Or is it just
familiar death?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>What’s your Saturday? Where are you stuck between death
and resurrection?</strong></p>
<p>Maybe something has already died—a marriage, a career, a certainty, a
self—and you’re in the tomb. Between the death and whatever comes
next.</p>
<p>Saturday is disorienting. You can’t go back to Friday (that life is
dead). You can’t see Sunday yet (transformation is still hidden). You’re
just… waiting.</p>
<p>If you’re in Saturday, name it. You’re not stuck. You’re in passage.
The tomb is part of the journey.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>What would it look like to live as someone who’s already
let the old self die?</strong></p>
<p>Imagine for a moment: What if the false self is already gone? What if
the performance, the control, the fear—what if it’s already dead?</p>
<p>What would you let go of? What would you stop protecting? How would
you live differently?</p>
<p>You’re not trying to kill what’s already dead. You’re learning to
stop resuscitating it.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>What would resurrection look like for you?</strong></p>
<p>Not going back to the old life. Not returning to what was. But being
transformed into something new.</p>
<p>You can’t orchestrate resurrection. You can’t force it. But you can
imagine it. You can hope for it.</p>
<p>What new life might be emerging from this death? What new self might
be born from this tomb?</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="closing-image-1">Closing Image</h2>
<p>The tomb. Silent. Dark. Waiting.</p>
<p>Saturday—the day between death and resurrection. The most honest
place to be.</p>
<p>You’ve died. Or something in you has died. Or something needs to die
and you’re finally letting it.</p>
<p>And now you’re here. In the dark. In the silence. In the waiting.</p>
<p>It doesn’t feel like grace. It feels like loss. It feels like the
end.</p>
<p>But here’s what the tomb teaches: Death is not the end. It’s
passage.</p>
<p>There’s a story of someone spending Saturday in the grave. Silent.
Still. Hidden.</p>
<p>Those who loved him spent Saturday in despair, thinking it was over.
Thinking Friday’s death was final.</p>
<p>They didn’t know Sunday was coming. They couldn’t see resurrection
from inside Saturday.</p>
<p>Neither can you.</p>
<p>But it’s coming anyway.</p>
<p>The tomb is dark, but it’s not empty. Love is there. In the silence.
In the waiting. In the dying.</p>
<p>And love is the force that raises the dead.</p>
<p>So you wait. You grieve. You trust.</p>
<p>This is not passivity. This is not giving up. This is the hardest
work there is—letting go of what you desperately wanted to keep,
releasing what you thought defined you, surrendering control over
outcomes you can’t control anyway.</p>
<p><em>Take a breath.</em></p>
<p>You let what needs to die stay dead.</p>
<p>No resuscitation of the old self. No resurrection of the false
identity. No revival of the patterns that brought you to the swamp in
the first place.</p>
<p>Dead stays dead.</p>
<p>But death is not the last word.</p>
<p>And you keep your face turned toward Sunday—toward transformation you
can’t yet see but believe is coming anyway.</p>
<p>Saturday is dark. Saturday is silent. Saturday is waiting.</p>
<p>But Saturday is not forever.</p>
<p>Because dying changes everything.</p>
<p>And Sunday always comes.</p>

How I Found Truth (Movement 2)</h1>
<h3 id="movement-2-at-the-waters-edge-the-turning-1">MOVEMENT 2: AT THE
WATER’S EDGE (The Turning)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“On the last day, the climax of the festival, Jesus stood and shouted
to the crowds, ‘Anyone who is thirsty may come to me! Anyone who
believes in me may come and drink! For the Scriptures declare, “Rivers
of living water will flow from his heart.”’”</p>
<p>— John 7:37-38 (NLT)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You’ve left the swamp.</p>
<p>It wasn’t easy. Maybe you’re still looking back over your shoulder,
wondering if you made the right choice. Your feet are heavy with swamp
mud. Your clothes are soaked, clinging to you. You smell like the muck
you just escaped.</p>
<p>But you’re here. At the water’s edge.</p>
<p>This is liminal space. The in-between. Not swamp anymore, but not
healed yet either. Not drowning, but not dancing. Not death, but not
resurrection. Not Friday, not Sunday.</p>
<p>This is Saturday. Tomb time. Transition.</p>
<p>The water’s edge is where grace does its most subversive work.</p>
<p>You want to clean yourself up before you step into the water. You’re
embarrassed by the mud, the stench, the evidence of where you’ve been.
Surely you need to get yourself together first, right?</p>
<p>Wrong.</p>
<p>Grace says: Come as you are. Mud and all. Shame and all. Questions
and all.</p>
<p>The water isn’t there to judge you. It’s there to wash you.</p>
<p>But here’s the hard part: You have to let yourself be washed. You
have to get in the water. You have to let grace touch the wounds.</p>
<p>And that’s terrifying.</p>
<p>Because what if you’re too dirty? What if the water rejects you? What
if grace has limits and you’ve exceeded them?</p>
<p>These chapters—5 through 8—are about discovering the answer to those
fears. And the answer is always the same: Grace is deeper than your
shame. Wider than your failure. Stronger than your sin. More persistent
than your doubt.</p>
<p><strong>The Journey at the Water’s Edge:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Chapter 5: Living Waters Edge</strong> - You stand at the
edge of the water, filthy from the swamp, convinced you have to clean
yourself up before you can approach. But grace invites you to come as
you are. The water doesn’t recoil—it receives you. This is the
scandalous truth: you don’t clean yourself up to receive grace. You
receive grace to be cleaned.</p>
<p><a

Waters Edge</a></p>
<p><strong>Chapter 6: In the Shadow of Your Grace</strong> - In the
desert of transition, you discover that grace isn’t just rescue from the
pit—it’s shelter in the wilderness. The shadow doesn’t remove the sun;
it provides covering under it. You learn the difference between hiding
FROM truth and hiding IN truth. And you discover that the shadow proves
the light is real.</p>

the Shadow of Your Grace</a></p>
<p><strong>Chapter 7: Amazing Grace I Did Receive</strong> - You stand
at the water’s edge covered in the consequences of your choices—the
shame of trampling on grace, the grave of autonomy, the dead-end road of
self-rule. And you hear the whisper: “Amazing grace, how sweet the
sound, that saved a wretch like me.” Not someone mostly good. A wretch.
Grace is scandalous precisely because it’s for those who don’t deserve
it. And when you step toward the water, you feel Love’s hand lifting you
from the grave.</p>

Grace</a></p>
<p><strong>Chapter 8: Dig a Little Deeper</strong> - The surface mud is
washing away, but underneath is scar tissue—layers of protection, coping
mechanisms, wounds you’ve been medicating for years. Real healing
requires going deeper. Cutting through the scar tissue. Opening the
wound so it can drain. Excavating through performance, shame, wounds,
and false beliefs until you hit bedrock truth: You are loved. You are
worthy. You are enough. And grace goes all the way down.</p>

<h2 id="entering-this-movement-1">Entering This Movement</h2>
<p>Before you wade into these four chapters, pause here at the water’s
edge. Look at where you’ve been. Feel where you are. Prepare for what
comes next.</p>
<p><strong>Look back at the swamp.</strong></p>
<p>You’ve come through Movement 1. That wasn’t easy. You got honest. You
named the swamp. You cried out. You made the decision. You let something
die.</p>
<p>That took courage. Real courage. Not the kind that pretends to be
strong, but the kind that admits weakness.</p>
<p>Don’t minimize what you did. Don’t rush past it. You stepped out of
the swamp. That matters.</p>
<p><strong>Look at where you are now.</strong></p>
<p>You’re at the edge of the water. Still carrying the mud from the
swamp. Still smelling like the muck you just escaped. Still a little
shaky from the journey.</p>
<p>You’re in liminal space. The in-between. Not swamp anymore, but not
healed yet either.</p>
<p>This is uncomfortable. Liminal space always is. Because you’re
between identities—no longer who you were, not yet who you’re
becoming.</p>
<p>But this is also sacred space. Because this is where grace does its
most transforming work.</p>
<p><strong>What this movement requires:</strong></p>
<p>Movement 1 required honesty. You had to stop pretending and get real
about the swamp.</p>
<p>Movement 2 requires receptivity. You have to let yourself be washed,
held, healed. You have to receive what you can’t earn.</p>
<p>That’s harder than it sounds.</p>
<p>Because everything in you wants to clean yourself up first. To prove
you’re worthy of grace. To do something to deserve the healing.</p>
<p>But grace doesn’t work that way. Grace says: Come as you are. Receive
what you can’t earn. Let yourself be loved.</p>
<p>Can you do that?</p>
<p>Can you step into the water without trying to clean yourself up
first?</p>
<p>Can you receive grace even though you don’t deserve it?</p>
<p>Can you let yourself be known—really known, mud and all—and still
believe you’re loved?</p>
<p>That’s the work of Movement 2.</p>
<p><strong>The woman at the well knew this.</strong></p>
<p>She came to draw water at noon—the hottest time of day, when nobody
else would be there. She was hiding from judgment, carrying shame from
five failed marriages.</p>
<p>And she met Someone there who offered “living water”—water that
becomes a spring welling up to eternal life.</p>
<p>She tried to deflect. To change the subject. To avoid being fully
known.</p>
<p>But He kept bringing her back to the truth: I see you. All of you.
And I’m offering you living water anyway.</p>
<p>Being truly known and truly loved—that’s what she discovered at the
well.</p>
<p>That’s what you’re about to discover at the water’s edge.</p>
<p><strong>One question before you begin:</strong></p>
<p>Are you willing to be known?</p>
<p>Not the version of yourself you present to the world. But the real
you. The one who’s been hiding in the swamp. The one who’s afraid of
being rejected. The one who’s convinced there’s not enough grace for
them.</p>
<p>Are you willing to let grace see all of that? And trust that it’s
enough?</p>
<p>If you are—even tentatively, even uncertainly—then you’re ready.</p>
<p>The water is here. The invitation is extended. Grace is waiting.</p>
<p><em>Wade in. One step at a time. The water’s not going to hurt you.
It’s going to heal you.</em></p>
<p><em>When you’re ready, turn to Chapter 5: Living Waters
Edge.</em></p>

WATER’S EDGE (The Turning)</h3>
<h3 id="chapter-5-living-waters-edge">Chapter 5: Living Waters Edge</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“Whoever drinks the water I give them will never thirst. Indeed, the
water I give them will become in them a spring of water welling up to
eternal life.” — John 4:14</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Have you ever stood at a threshold between your old life and
something new? Not knowing if you’re ready. Not sure you’re worthy.
Covered in the evidence of where you’ve been, wondering if you’re clean
enough to step forward?</p>
<p>That’s where this chapter lives. At the water’s edge.</p>
<p>And here’s what I want you to know: You don’t have to clean up first.
The water is what cleans you.</p>
<p>I know that might sound strange. Or too good to be true. Or like
spiritual talk that doesn’t apply to real life.</p>
<p>But stay with me. Because this chapter is about the moment when
everything you’ve been carrying—the shame, the failure, the mud from the
swamp—meets something that can actually wash it away.</p>
<p>Can you be open to that possibility? Even if you don’t fully believe
it yet?</p>
<p>If you prayed that prayer—even tentatively, even with doubts still
swirling—something real just happened. Not because the words were magic.
But because God was listening. And when you opened the door, He stepped
in.</p>
<p>You might not feel different right away. You might still feel stuck,
still feel afraid. That’s okay. This is the beginning, not the end. The
decision has been made. Now comes the journey.</p>
<p>This chapter is about what happens when you step into the water. When
you let grace wash over you. When you discover that the water doesn’t
recoil from your mud—it cleanses it.</p>
<p>Keep reading. You’re about to get wet.</p>
<p>There’s a moment between leaving and arriving that feels
impossible.</p>
<p>You’ve left the swamp—made the decision, taken the first steps,
walked away from the place that was killing you. But you haven’t arrived
anywhere yet. You’re in the liminal space. The threshold. The water’s
edge.</p>
<p>Behind you: everything you’ve known. The familiar toxicity. The
adaptive survival patterns. The identity you built in the muck.</p>
<p>Ahead of you: the unknown. Clean water that both attracts and
terrifies you. An invitation you’re not sure you’re qualified to
accept.</p>
<p>And here’s what makes this moment so hard: the swamp is still on you.
You can smell it on your clothes. Feel the dried mud cracking on your
skin. Taste the bitterness in your mouth. You’ve left, but you’re not
yet clean. You’ve chosen freedom, but you’re not yet free.</p>
<p>This is the water’s edge—where decision meets transformation. Where
leaving meets arriving. Where the old is passing away but the new hasn’t
yet fully come.</p>
<p>And the question that haunts you: Can I really step into that clean
water looking like this?</p>
<p>Part of you wants to clean up first. Get yourself together. Become
worthy of the gift before you receive it.</p>
<p>But there’s no pre-water ritual. No “get yourself ready first”
station.</p>
<p>Just the water. And you. And the invitation.</p>
<p>The writing that follows came from my time at this threshold. When
I’d made the decision to leave but couldn’t yet see how transformation
would happen. When I stood at the edge of grace, covered in swamp, and
had to learn the hardest lesson:</p>
<p>You don’t clean up to receive grace. Grace is what cleans you up.</p>
<p>You kneel at the water’s edge, hands trembling. The bank is soft
under your knees. You lean forward, cupping your hands together, and dip
them into the water.</p>
<p>It’s shockingly cool. But also… alive. You can feel the current
trying to pull your hands downstream. You can feel the movement, the
energy, the power.</p>
<p>You lift your cupped hands to your lips and drink.</p>
<p>The water is cool and sweet and everything you didn’t know you
needed. It tastes like snow-melt and stone and something you can only
call purity. It washes away the bitter taste of the swamp, the metallic
tang of fear, the sour residue of shame.</p>
<p>You drink again. And again. Greedy for it now. Desperate for it.</p>
<p>And as you drink, something inside you whispers: This is what I’ve
been thirsting for. Not just water. Living water. The kind that reaches
all the way down into the dried-up, hollowed-out places and says, “I can
make this live again.”</p>
<p>You look at the river. Then at yourself. Then back at the river.</p>
<p>The invitation is clear: Come in. Let yourself be washed. Let the
water do what you cannot do for yourself.</p>
<p>But can you? Can you really step into that clean water covered in all
this filth? Can you trust that the water is strong enough to handle your
mess?</p>
<p>The sun climbs higher. The mist begins to thin. And you’re still
kneeling at the water’s edge, caught between the swamp you’ve left and
the cleansing you need, wondering if grace is really as scandalous as
they say—scandalous enough to wash even you.</p>
<h3 id="the-threshold-where-obedience-meets-miracle">2. The Threshold –
Where Obedience Meets Miracle</h3>
<p>Or consider another story from the book of Joshua. Ancient Israel
stood on the edge of the promised land after wandering forty years.
Between them and the promise: the Jordan River. And it’s not just
flowing—it’s flooding:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It was the harvest season, and the Jordan was overflowing its banks.
But as soon as the feet of the priests who were carrying the Ark touched
the water at the river’s edge, the water above that point began backing
up a great distance away… And all the people crossed over.”</p>
<p>— Joshua 3:15-16 (NLT)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>God gives Joshua strange instructions: Have the priests carrying the
ark of the covenant step into the water. Not after it parts. Before.
While it’s still flooding.</p>
<p>They have to get their feet wet before the miracle happens.</p>
<p>Imagine being one of those priests. Carrying the most sacred
object—the symbol of divine presence—toward a flooding river. Every
instinct screams: Wait for the water to stop! Don’t risk it! Don’t step
in until it’s safe!</p>
<p>But that’s not how trust works. Trust doesn’t wait for risk to
disappear. Trust steps in while the risk is real.</p>
<p>And they do it. The moment their feet touch the water’s edge, the
water from upstream stops flowing.</p>
<p>The water’s edge is where obedience meets miracle. Where faith
becomes sight. Where stepping forward in trust releases transformative
power.</p>
<p>The edge is the threshold. You can stand on the shore and talk about
water all day. You can study it, analyze it, understand its chemical
composition. But until you step in—until your feet touch the water’s
edge—you don’t experience it.</p>
<p>Eugene Peterson writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The Christian life is not a quiet escape to a garden where we can
walk and talk uninterruptedly with our Lord; nor is it a fantasy trip to
a heavenly city where we can compare our blue ribbons and gold medals
with other Christians… It is the active and loving obedience of faith,
lived in the rough and tumble of this world, where God’s grace
intersects with human need.”</p>
<p>— Eugene Peterson, <em>A Long Obedience in the Same
Direction</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The water’s edge is where that intersection happens. Where grace
meets our desperate need. Where theology becomes experience.</p>
<h3 id="the-transition-from-running-from-to-running-toward">3. The
Transition from Running From to Running Toward</h3>
<p>There’s a psychological and spiritual shift that happens at the
water’s edge. A reversal. A turning.</p>
<p>Before, we run from what’s Real. We hide like the first humans in the
garden: “I heard you, and I was afraid because I was naked; so I
hid.”</p>
<p>We flee like Jonah, running to get as far from truth’s call as
possible, ending up in the belly of a fish before we finally
surrender.</p>
<p>We avoid by staying so busy with activity that we never have to face
the intimacy that Reality actually wants with us.</p>
<p>Why do we run? Because we’re afraid. Afraid Reality will see the real
us and be disappointed. Afraid it will demand things we’re not willing
to give. Afraid we’ll be rejected if we don’t perform well enough.
Afraid that if we get too close, we’ll discover that love has conditions
after all.</p>
<p>So we run. Or we hide. Or we stay busy. Anything to keep truth at
arm’s length.</p>
<p>But the swamp changes things. In the swamp, hiding doesn’t work
anymore. Performance fails. Busyness exhausts us. And we discover that
we’re not running from judgment—we’re running from love.</p>
<p>Because judgment we could handle. We’ve been handling judgment our
whole lives. Self-judgment, others’ judgment, internalized shame—we know
what to do with that. We perform, we prove ourselves, we try harder.</p>
<p>But love? Unconditional, unearned, relentless love? That’s
terrifying.</p>
<p>Because if we’re loved as we are, then we have to stop performing.
Stop earning. Stop hiding. And we don’t know who we’d be without all
that.</p>
<p>At the water’s edge, something shifts. We stop running from and start
stumbling toward.</p>
<p>We start seeking like the ancient poet: “As the deer pants for
streams of water, so my soul pants for you.”</p>
<p>We start thirsting like the crowds who heard Jesus cry out: “Let
anyone who is thirsty come to me and drink.”</p>
<p>We start reaching like the woman with the issue of blood, desperate
enough to push through the crowd and touch the hem of Jesus’ garment
because we finally realize: Our greatest danger isn’t being seen in our
need. Our greatest danger is dying of thirst while standing next to the
fountain.</p>
<p>A.W. Tozer understood this desperate thirst:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“God is looking for people through whom He can do the impossible—what
a pity that we plan only the things that we can do by ourselves.”</p>
<p>— A.W. Tozer, <em>The Pursuit of God</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We come to the water when we finally admit we can’t save ourselves.
When we stop planning what we can do and start receiving what only God
can do.</p>
<p>For years, I ran. I was in involved, teaching, doing all the “right
things”—and running. Because I was terrified He’d get too close and see
the real me. The mess. The doubt. The darkness. The anger. The parts
that didn’t fit the image.</p>
<p>The swamp was awful, but at least I could hide there. At least the
mud covered me. At least I could blend into the murk and no one—not even
God—could see clearly.</p>
<p>But at the water’s edge, I couldn’t hide anymore. I was exposed.
Vulnerable. Raw.</p>
<p>And I realized: I wasn’t running from judgment. I was running from
love.</p>
<p>The water’s edge is where I stopped running from God and started
stumbling toward Him. Where I discovered that the most honest prayer I
could pray wasn’t “Make me good enough.” It was “See me as I am—and
please don’t turn away.”</p>
<p>And He didn’t. He doesn’t. He never does.</p>
<h3 id="baptism-death-to-old-birth-to-new">4. Baptism: Death to Old,
Birth to New</h3>
<p>Baptism is the ritual of the water’s edge—the physical enactment of
what happens spiritually when we come to God.</p>
<p><strong>Baptism is obedience.</strong> Even Jesus submitted to
baptism, telling John the Baptist: “It should be done, for we must carry
out all that God requires” (Matthew 3:15, NLT). After His resurrection,
Jesus commanded His followers: “Go and make disciples of all the
nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the
Holy Spirit” (Matthew 28:19, NLT). This isn’t optional—it’s a
command.</p>
<p><strong>Baptism is death and resurrection.</strong> Going under the
water: Death. Burial of the old self. The swamp-covered, broken version
of you dies. Coming up out of the water: Resurrection. New life. You
emerge clean, forgiven, made new.</p>
<p>This isn’t just metaphor. Paul says it’s spiritually real:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“For we died and were buried with Christ by baptism. And just as
Christ was raised from the dead by the glorious power of the Father, now
we also may live new lives. Since we have been united with him in his
death, we will also be raised to life as he was.”</p>
<p>— Romans 6:4-5 (NLT)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you go under the water, you’re united with Christ in His death.
When you come up, you’re united with Him in His resurrection.</p>
<p><strong>Why baptism matters:</strong> It’s obedience to Jesus’s
command. It’s your public declaration before witnesses—“I belong to
Jesus now.” It’s a spiritual marker, a covenant moment that changes
something we don’t fully understand. And it’s your initiation into the
community of believers.</p>
<p><strong>Have you considered baptism?</strong></p>
<p>If you prayed that prayer earlier in this chapter—if you invited God
into your soul—then baptism is your next step. Not because you have to
earn anything, but because obedience flows from love. Because public
declaration solidifies private decision. Because there’s something
powerful about going under the water and coming up new.</p>
<p>Talk to a pastor. Find a church community. Schedule your baptism.
Step into the water.</p>
<p>Standing at the water’s edge forever isn’t the goal. The goal is to
step in. To go under. To come up new.</p>
<p>And if you’ve already been baptized, remember your baptism. Remember
the old you that died and the new you that rose. Remember the covenant
you made, the identity you claimed, the life you said yes to.</p>
<p>Baptism isn’t only about our pledge to God—it’s also about God’s
pledge to us. The water’s edge is where we receive what Love offers, not
where we prove we’re worthy to receive it.</p>
<h3 id="the-vulnerability-of-letting-yourself-be-washed">5. The
Vulnerability of Letting Yourself Be Washed</h3>
<p>There’s something deeply vulnerable about being washed. To be washed,
you have to be touched. You have to let someone see the dirt. You have
to stop hiding.</p>
<p>This is the tender, terrifying heart of the chapter.</p>
<p>Think about Jesus washing the disciples’ feet in John 13:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“When Jesus came to Simon Peter, Peter said to him, ‘Lord, are you
going to wash my feet?’ Jesus replied, ‘You don’t understand now what I
am doing, but someday you will.’ ‘No,’ Peter protested, ‘you will never
ever wash my feet!’ Jesus replied, ‘Unless I wash you, you won’t belong
to me.’”</p>
<p>— John 13:6-8 (NLT)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s the night before His crucifixion. Jesus knows what’s coming. And
He takes off His outer garment, wraps a towel around His waist, pours
water into a basin, and begins washing their feet.</p>
<p>Peter’s reaction is classic: “No, you will never ever wash my
feet!”</p>
<p>Why? Because it’s humiliating. The Master shouldn’t serve the
servant. The clean shouldn’t touch the dirty. This is backwards. Wrong.
Uncomfortable.</p>
<p>But Jesus says something profound: “Unless I wash you, you won’t
belong to me.”</p>
<p>Let that sink in. Unless I wash you. Not “unless you wash yourself.”
Not “unless you clean up first.” Unless I wash you.</p>
<p>What’s He saying? You’re already loved. Already accepted. Already
Mine. You just need to let Me serve you. Let Me wash the parts of you
that have gotten dirty walking through this world. Let Me touch the
places you think are too shameful, too broken, too contaminated.</p>
<p>For us, the vulnerability is this: Admitting we need washing.
Admitting we can’t clean ourselves up. Admitting we’re dirty and letting
Love touch the dirt.</p>
<p>That’s terrifying. Because what if it recoils? What if even grace has
limits? What if I’m too much even for living water?</p>
<p>But the wayfarer at the water’s edge discovers: Grace has no limits.
Grace washes what shame says is unwashable. Grace touches what fear says
is untouchable.</p>
<p>Timothy Keller illuminates this scandalous grace:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The gospel is this: We are more sinful and flawed in ourselves than
we ever dared believe, yet at the very same time we are more loved and
accepted in Jesus Christ than we ever dared hope.”</p>
<p>— Timothy Keller, <em>The Meaning of Marriage</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the water’s edge truth: You’re worse than you thought—and
more loved than you imagined. Both at the same time.</p>
<p>At the water’s edge, I was trying hard to practice vulnerability and
connection. I was meeting with friends, making progress on creative
projects, engaging in introspection and prayer. Outwardly, momentum was
building.</p>
<p>But I was also exhausted. Disconnected at times. Empty in ways I
couldn’t quite articulate.</p>
<p>The water’s edge isn’t instant healing. It’s the beginning of
healing. You can be making real progress and still feel the weight of
the journey. That’s not failure—that’s honesty.</p>
<p>Ruth Haley Barton writes about this tender in-between place:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Transformation is not about trying harder or doing more. It is about
entering more deeply into the mystery of our own belovedness… and
trusting the process that is beyond our control.”</p>
<p>— Ruth Haley Barton, <em>Sacred Rhythms</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the water’s edge, we learn to trust the process even when we can’t
control the outcome. We step in, covered in mud, and trust the water to
do what only water can do.</p>
<p>You can be stepping toward the water and still be covered in swamp
mud. That’s not hypocrisy—that’s the reality of transformation. It
doesn’t happen all at once. It happens in stages, in steps, in moments
of surrender and trust.</p>
<h2 id="the-wayfarer-moment-2">The Wayfarer Moment</h2>
<p><strong>You don’t clean yourself up before you come to the water. You
come to the water to be cleaned.</strong></p>
<p>This is the scandal of grace. The offense of it. The relief of
it.</p>
<p>You don’t have to fix yourself first. You can’t. That’s the whole
point.</p>
<p>You come as you are. Mud-covered. Shame-soaked. Exhausted from trying
and failing. Broken from years of pretending. Thirsty beyond words.</p>
<p>And grace washes you.</p>
<p>For months—maybe years, if I’m honest—I’d been wrestling with
unworthiness. Watching other people experience breakthrough, healing,
transformation. Hearing their testimonies of miracles. Witnessing the
joy that comes when someone is made whole.</p>
<p>And feeling… nothing. Except the growing conviction that miracles
were for other people. Not for me.</p>
<p>I felt like a lost cause. Weighed down by shame so heavy I could
barely breathe. I was angry at God. I shouted at Him in the darkness:
“Why not me, Lord? Why am I not deserving? If You were truly a God of
love and compassion, You are the one I would be serving. But You’re not
showing up for me.”</p>
<p>I walked away that night. Heart hardened. Or so I told myself.</p>
<p>But the hardness was a lie. Underneath it was crushing hope—hope that
there could be a Savior who actually loved me, who would actually pay my
debt. Hope that had been beaten down so many times it had learned to
hide behind anger.</p>
<p>The turning point came in April 2014. I flew to Oklahoma City to
visit my best friend. That night, I went to watch the Thunder play the
Spurs—trying to escape, to forget about my miserable lot in life, to
flee from how I’d destroyed my family and marriage.</p>
<p>But you know what they say: The only problem with running is that
everywhere you go, you’re there.</p>
<p>The next morning I woke up, and I was still there. Still carrying the
mess I’d created back home. I decided it was time to do some work on my
life. Which meant—for me—going somewhere to think, to pray, to
meditate.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.skylerthomas.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/HefnerBridge-v20140412d-Blue-Sky_tonemapped.jpg" alt="Lake Hefner boat ramp" />
<em>Oklahoma City, Lake Hefner</em></p>
<p>I found myself at Lake Hefner in North Oklahoma City, sitting at the
end of a boat ramp. Figuratively, it looked like my life: the end of the
road.</p>
<p>What would I do?</p>
<p>I walked to the end of the boat ramp. Sat down. Contemplated my
situation. Still wearing my mask. Still pretending I had it together.
Still performing rather than being real.</p>
<p>How do you break free from yourself? From the bondage that keeps you
enslaved to shame and performance and the need to look good?</p>
<p>I put my headphones on and played a song—“Word of God Speak” by
MercyMe—over and over and over. And I wept completely, from the deepest
part of my inner being.</p>
<p><em>I’m finding myself at a loss for words</em> <em>And the funny
thing is it’s okay</em> <em>The last thing I need is to be heard</em>
<em>But to hear what You would say</em></p>
<p><em>Word of God speak</em> <em>Would You pour down like rain</em>
<em>Washing my eyes to see</em> <em>Your majesty</em> <em>To be still
and know</em> <em>That You’re in this place</em> <em>Please let me stay
and rest</em> <em>In Your holiness</em> <em>Word of God speak</em></p>
<p>What happened next? I guess I’ll just say: I received my miracle.</p>
<p>I stepped off the end of the road and started walking toward the
water. With each step, I asked the Holy Spirit to embrace me. Asked God
to give me a much-needed miracle in my life.</p>
<p>I put my feet into the water. The Living Water’s Edge.</p>
<p>And I was comforted in knowing: it’s going to be okay.</p>
<p>The water didn’t recoil from my shame. It didn’t reject the mess I’d
made. It received me. Cool, real, life-giving.</p>
<p>That’s grace. Not the reward for cleaning up. The power that
cleanses.</p>
<p>That moment became my permission slip. Permission to admit I wanted a
miracle. Permission to confess I felt unworthy. Permission to take off
the mask and come to the water’s edge as I actually was—broken,
desperate, thirsty.</p>
<p>The writing that follows came from that day. The song came later, as
these raw confessions transformed into declaration. The writing asks
questions: Have you ever wanted a miracle? Have you ever seen one? The
song answers: Come to the living water’s edge. The miracle is available.
You can be made whole.</p>
<p>The writing is the struggle. The song is the musical translation.</p>
<h2 id="lyrics-living-waters-edge">Lyrics: Living Water’s Edge</h2>
<p><strong>(Verse 1)</strong></p>
<p>Have you longed for a miracle, felt unworthy to believe? Burdened
down by guilt and shame, no hope to be relieved. In the darkness, you
have wondered, “Can I ever be made whole?” Jesus stands with arms wide
open, He’s the Savior of your soul.</p>
<p><strong>(Verse 2)</strong></p>
<p>Have you seen a heart surrendered, healed by mercy’s gentle hand?
Felt the joy of restoration, love you cannot understand? Bring your pain
and all your burdens; leave them at the cross tonight. Let His power
make you righteous, shining pure in holy light.</p>
<p><strong>(Chorus)</strong></p>
<p>Have you seen a miracle, felt His love that sets you free? It’s a
gift beyond all measure, full of grace and majesty. Come and drink the
living water, let it wash your fear away. Jesus breaks the chains that
bind you; He’s your miracle today.</p>
<p><strong>(Verse 3)</strong></p>
<p>Have you felt the weight of sorrow, like a chain you cannot break?
Every step feels weak and heavy, every move a deep mistake. Jesus sees
your every struggle, and He whispers, “You are Mine.” Through His grace,
the chains will shatter; you will rise in love divine.</p>
<p><strong>(Bridge)</strong></p>
<p>Lift your hands and call upon Him; He will meet you where you stand.
Every tear and cry of sorrow, He will hold within His hand. Feel the
freedom in His presence, leave your past and walk His way. Jesus loves
you and redeems you; He’s your miracle today.</p>
<p><strong>(Chorus)</strong></p>
<p>Have you seen a miracle, felt His love that sets you free? It’s a
gift beyond all measure, full of grace and majesty. Come and drink the
living water, let it wash your fear away. Jesus breaks the chains that
bind you; He’s your miracle today.</p>
<p><strong>(Outro)</strong></p>
<p>He’s your miracle today, Jesus is your miracle today.</p>
<h2 id="reflections-for-the-road-2">Reflections for the Road</h2>
<p>These aren’t homework. They’re invitations. Gentle questions to help
you engage with your own thirst, your own need for living water.</p>
<p><strong>Questions for the Journey:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Where are you with the water? Still in the swamp? At the
edge? Already in, being washed?</strong></p>
<p>Be honest about where you actually are, not where you think you
should be. If you’re still in the swamp, that’s okay. If you’re at the
edge but afraid to step in, that’s okay too. Grace meets you where you
are.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>What’s keeping you from stepping into the water? Fear?
Shame? Unworthiness? The belief that you have to clean up
first?</strong></p>
<p>Name the obstacle. Shame loses its power when it’s brought into the
light. Fear shrinks when it’s spoken aloud. What’s the lie you’re
believing about grace?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Read John 4 slowly. Put yourself in the woman’s place.
What does Jesus see in you? What does He offer?</strong></p>
<p>This isn’t theological study. This is personal encounter. Imagine
yourself at the well. Imagine Jesus asking you for a drink. Imagine Him
seeing everything you’ve ever done—and offering you living water
anyway.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>What would it mean to stop trying to clean yourself up
and just come to the water?</strong></p>
<p>What would change if you stopped performing? Stopped trying to earn
grace? Stopped waiting to be good enough? What if you came as you
are—right now, in this moment, with all your mess—and let grace wash
you?</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="closing-image-2">Closing Image</h2>
<p>You’re standing in the water now. Not all the way in—just ankles
deep. Just enough to feel it’s real. Cool and shocking and clean.</p>
<p>The mud from the swamp is starting to wash away. Not instantly. Not
all at once. But gradually. With each step deeper, more of it lifts off.
Carried downstream by the current.</p>
<p>You look down at your feet. You can see them through the water.
Clear. The stones beneath them smooth and solid.</p>
<p>You look at your hands. Still muddy. But less than before.</p>
<p>You cup water and pour it over your arms. Watch the mud run off in
brown streams. Underneath: skin. Your actual skin. You’d almost
forgotten what it looked like.</p>
<p>You’re still a mess. You’re still covered in swamp. But you’re also
being washed. Both are true at the same time.</p>
<p><em>Take a breath.</em></p>
<p>This is the water’s edge. Not instant transformation. The beginning
of transformation. Not immediate perfection. The start of healing.</p>
<p>You take another step. The water rises to your knees. Colder.
Stronger current. But also… invigorating. Alive.</p>
<p>You’re wading in. One step at a time. Letting the water do what you
could never do for yourself.</p>
<p>And somewhere deep inside, beneath the shame and the fear and the
exhaustion, something stirs. Something that feels almost like… hope.</p>
<p>Not the fragile, easily crushed hope you’ve known before. But
something sturdier. Something rooted not in your ability to clean
yourself up, but in the water’s ability to wash you.</p>
<p>Living water.</p>
<p>You’re at the water’s edge. And you’re wading in. And it’s the
beginning of everything.</p>

WATER’S EDGE (The Turning)</h3>
<h3 id="chapter-6-in-the-shadow-of-your-grace">Chapter 6: In the Shadow
of Your Grace</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“Whoever dwells in the shelter of the Most High will rest in the
shadow of the Almighty.” — Psalm 91:1</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>An Invitation to Reflect</strong></p>
<p>You’ve walked through five chapters now. You’ve named the swamp,
cried out for help, made a decision to move, let something die, and
stepped into living water.</p>
<p>Maybe you’ve even accepted baptism—that powerful symbol of death to
the old and birth to the new.</p>
<p>But now I need to ask you something important:</p>
<p><strong>How seriously have you been able to accept God? To accept
Jesus? To accept the living water of baptism washing over
you?</strong></p>
<p>Are these just ideas you’re entertaining? Nice concepts you’re
considering? Or are you actually letting them change you?</p>
<p>Because here’s what I’ve discovered: there’s a difference between
acknowledging truth and living in it. Between knowing about the water
and actually staying immersed in it.</p>
<p>You’ve made it this far. But the journey doesn’t end at the water’s
edge. The question is: <strong>Are you ready to continue this journey
dwelling in the living water and moving forward with your
life?</strong></p>
<p>Not going back to the swamp. Not just standing at the edge analyzing.
But actually walking forward, day by day, learning what it means to live
washed, sheltered, and held by grace.</p>
<p>This isn’t about perfection. It’s about direction. It’s about
choosing, again and again, to stay in the water rather than retreat to
what’s familiar.</p>
<p>So before you read further, pause. Consider:</p>
<p><em>Can you say, even imperfectly: “God, I’m choosing to stay in the
water. I’m choosing to keep walking forward. I’m choosing to let Your
love define me, even when it’s hard, even when the wilderness stretches
ahead, even when I don’t understand everything yet.”</em></p>
<p>That’s enough. That’s the commitment that opens what comes next.</p>
<p>Because in this chapter, you’re going to discover something crucial:
Grace doesn’t just wash you. Grace shelters you for the journey
ahead.</p>
<p>You’ve been washed. You’ve stepped into the water, felt grace begin
its work, experienced the first cleansing. And you thought—maybe you
hoped—that would be the end of the hard part.</p>
<p>But you’re discovering something: leaving the swamp doesn’t mean
instant arrival in paradise. There’s a wilderness between the swamp and
the promised land. A space of formation. A season of walking.</p>
<p>And the wilderness is hard in different ways.</p>
<p>The swamp was toxic and suffocating. The wilderness is exposed and
relentless. In the swamp, you couldn’t breathe. In the wilderness, you
feel every scorching reality. Heat beats down. The path stretches
endlessly. Your resources feel insufficient.</p>
<p>This is where many wayfarers give up. They expect grace to remove
them from all difficulty. Eliminate every trial. Make life comfortable
and easy. And when they discover grace does something different—provides
shelter within the trial rather than escape from it—they’re tempted to
turn back.</p>
<p>But here’s what you’re learning: grace isn’t just rescue from the
pit. Grace is also shelter in the wilderness.</p>
<p>The shadow doesn’t eliminate the sun. It provides covering under
it.</p>
<p>Grace doesn’t always remove the hard season. It shelters you through
it.</p>
<p>This chapter is about dwelling in that shadow. About learning that
presence in the midst of difficulty is grace enough. That you don’t face
the heat alone.</p>
<p>The writing that follows came from my wilderness season. When I’d
been washed but not yet arrived. When I had to learn that grace isn’t
always escape—sometimes it’s shelter. And that shelter is enough.</p>
<h2 id="stories-of-shadow">Stories of Shadow</h2>
<p><strong>Want to hear some ancient stories about this kind of
shelter?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ruth Under Boaz’s Wing (Ruth 2:12)</strong></p>
<p>Picture Ruth in the harvest fields of Bethlehem. She’s a Moabite
widow in a foreign land—no husband, no security, no legal protection.
Jewish law allows the poor to glean—to follow behind the harvesters and
gather whatever grain they drop or leave behind. It’s backbreaking work,
hot and humiliating, and you’re completely at the mercy of the field
owner’s generosity.</p>
<p>Ruth bends and gathers, bends and gathers, working from sunrise in
fields that aren’t hers, gleaning scraps to keep herself and her
mother-in-law Naomi from starving. She’s vulnerable. Exposed. A foreign
woman alone among men who could exploit her or drive her away.</p>
<p>Then Boaz, the field owner, notices her. He asks who she is. And when
he learns she’s the Moabite woman who left everything—her homeland, her
people, her gods—to follow Naomi and Naomi’s God, he speaks a blessing
over her that captures the heart of shadow grace:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“May the LORD, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to
take refuge, reward you fully for what you have done.”</p>
<p>— Ruth 2:12 (NLT)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ruth had left everything to come under the wing-shadow of Yahweh. She
sought shelter in the God of Israel even though she had no guarantee He
would provide. She was vulnerable, at risk, exposed—but she came under
His wings.</p>
<p>And what happens? God provides through Boaz. Protects her from harm.
Covers her in the harvest field. Redeems her story completely—she
marries Boaz, bears a son named Obed, and becomes part of the lineage of
King David and Jesus Himself.</p>
<p>Shadow grace doesn’t promise comfort or ease. But it promises
covering. And under that covering, redemption happens.</p>
<p><strong>Israelites Under the Cloud (Exodus 13:21-22)</strong></p>
<p>When God led Israel out of Egypt into the wilderness, He didn’t
remove the wilderness. The desert was still scorching hot by day, the
sun beating down on sand and rock with no trees for shelter, no streams
for relief. At night, the temperature plummeted—bitter cold under a vast
sky of stars.</p>
<p>But God didn’t leave them exposed. He accompanied them:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“By day the LORD went ahead of them in a pillar of cloud to guide
them on their way and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light,
so that they could travel by day or night. Neither the pillar of cloud
by day nor the pillar of fire by night left its place in front of the
people.”</p>
<p>— Exodus 13:21-22</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Imagine waking up in the desert camp, the sun just rising, heat
already building. You look ahead and there it is—the cloud. Massive.
Moving slowly in front of the camp. Leading. And as you walk behind it,
you notice: it’s not just showing direction. It’s providing shade.
Shadow. Covering from the relentless sun.</p>
<p>The cloud wasn’t just navigation—it was mercy. Protection. Visible,
tangible proof that God was present, leading, sheltering. In the
scorching wilderness, that shadow meant the difference between survival
and death.</p>
<p>At night, the cloud transformed into fire—warmth in the cold, light
in the darkness, constant reminder that they weren’t alone.</p>
<p>God didn’t teleport them to the promised land. He walked them through
the wilderness, step by step, mile by mile. But He never left them
exposed. The shadow of His presence covered them every single day of the
journey.</p>
<p><strong>Jesus’ Lament Over Jerusalem (Matthew 23:37)</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps the most heartbreaking image of shadow grace comes from Jesus
Himself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent
to you, how often I have longed to gather you together, as a hen gathers
her chicks under her wings, and you were not willing.”</p>
<p>— Matthew 23:37</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The tender image: a hen gathering her chicks under her wings. When
danger comes, the mother hen doesn’t run. She spreads her wings and
calls her chicks to safety beneath her. She covers them with her own
body, willing to take the blow herself to protect them.</p>
<p>This is the heart of God. Longing to gather us. Aching to cover us.
Willing to take the wounds so we can be sheltered.</p>
<p>But—and here’s the tragedy—we have to be willing. We have to come. We
have to run to the shelter instead of away from it.</p>
<p>The shadow is there. The wings are spread. The invitation is given.
Will we come?</p>
<p><strong>Deep Dive: Psalm 91</strong></p>
<p>We’ve touched on this psalm, but it deserves deeper exploration.
Psalm 91 is the ultimate shadow-grace text:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High will rest in the
shadow of the Almighty… He will cover you with his feathers, and under
his wings you will find refuge; his faithfulness will be your shield and
rampart. You will not fear the terror of night, nor the arrow that flies
by day, nor the pestilence that stalks in the darkness, nor the plague
that destroys at midday.”</p>
<p>— Psalm 91:1, 4-6</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice what God promises: - Shelter from terror - Refuge from arrows
- Protection from pestilence and plague</p>
<p>But notice what He doesn’t promise: <em>the absence of terror,
arrows, pestilence, or plague.</em></p>
<p>The dangers are still real. The threats still exist. But under the
shadow, we’re covered. The evil that would destroy us cannot penetrate
the shelter of those wings.</p>
<p>This is shadow grace: not immunity from trial, but invincibility in
trial. Not escape from danger, but safety within danger. Not the absence
of the storm, but the presence of Love in the storm.</p>
<h2 id="song-integration-3">Song Integration</h2>
<p>Standing in full sunlight at the height of my spiritual crisis, I
wasn’t basking in illumination—I was burning from exposure. Every wound
visible. Every failure on display. This is the paradox the comfortable
never understand: sometimes the problem isn’t darkness. Sometimes the
problem is too much light—too much exposure, too much harsh truth
without any corresponding shelter. You can die just as surely from
exposure as from darkness.</p>
<p>“In the Shadow of Your Grace” emerged from that scorched place. From
discovering what I needed wasn’t escape from reality but shelter within
it. Grace doesn’t always look like removal of difficulty—sometimes grace
looks like covering in the midst of it.</p>
<p>Western Christianity tends to emphasize victory, breakthrough,
deliverance—mountains moved, trials removed, circumstances changed. But
more often in the actual lived experience of faithful people, God
doesn’t remove the trial. He provides presence within it. Not escape,
but shelter. Not deliverance from, but companionship through.</p>
<p>Psalm 91 establishes this theology: “Whoever dwells in the shelter of
the Most High will rest in the shadow of the Almighty.”
<em>Dwelling</em>—not visiting, not dropping by in crisis, but making
your home. <em>Shelter</em> and <em>shadow</em>—protection from elements
that remain present. The psalm doesn’t promise the absence of “the
terror of night” or “the arrow that flies by day.” These threats are
real and present. The promise is covering, not elimination. This is the
scandal modern Christianity often tries to soften: following Jesus
doesn’t guarantee exemption from suffering. It guarantees we won’t
suffer alone.</p>
<p>The chapter’s original writing contrasts chronos (chronological,
measured time) with kairos (God’s time). In chronos, we’re trapped in
relentless succession—pain continues, shame persists, the cycle repeats.
But then kairos breaks in: God’s time intersects human time. The
confusion stops—not because circumstances change, but because presence
enters. “I don’t move in any direction / I bow down / And the roar of
the world is gone for a moment / And I listen.” Same circumstances.
Different time. Kairos doesn’t change what’s happening—it changes who’s
present in what’s happening.</p>
<p>The song tracks a transformation: from fear-based hiding to
faith-based hiding. From running away to running toward. “I’ve been
running, I’ve been hiding, worn out from the fight.” This is Genesis 3
hiding—afraid of being seen. When shame drives hiding, we hide
<em>from</em> exposure because we believe being fully known means being
fully rejected. “Tangled up in chains I fastened, lost inside the
night.” The chains are self-imposed—defense mechanisms that became
prisons, protective walls that became isolation chambers.</p>
<p>But the song pivots: “But You call my name, You take the weight, You
step right into my mistake.” God doesn’t wait at a safe distance for us
to clean up. He steps <em>into</em> the mistake. Into the mess. “You
tear the veil, You light the way”—referencing the temple veil torn at
Christ’s crucifixion (Matthew 27:51). What separated us from God’s
presence has been torn. Access is granted.</p>
<p>The chorus declares: “Oh, in the shadow of Your grace, every fear
begins to fade.” Not “instantly disappears” but “begins to fade.” Shadow
grace is a process. “Where mercy meets me face to face, I am free, I’m
not the same!” This is the paradox: in the shadow, somehow we’re face to
face. The shadow isn’t distance from the light source—it’s proximity to
it. You can only be in someone’s shadow if you’re close enough to be
covered by them.</p>
<p>The bridge: “No more hiding, no more grave, Hell is shaking, heaven
stays!” Resurrection language. “Chains are falling, fear erased, I am
free in Jesus’ name!” Not “will be free” but <em>am free</em>. Present
tense. Current reality. Freedom isn’t based on my progress—it’s based on
Jesus’s finished work.</p>
<p>The shadow of grace teaches crucial truths: Proximity matters more
than circumstances. Shelter is a form of deliverance—not from the
circumstance but from facing it alone. And the shadow is evidence of
light, not absence of it. You can’t have shadow without a light source.
The shadow doesn’t mean God is absent—it means He’s standing between us
and what would destroy us. In that shadow, transformation happens. Not
because you’re striving but because you’re dwelling. Not because you’re
performing but because you’re resting.</p>
<h2 id="key-takeaways-2">Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Grace shelters, not just rescues.</strong> God doesn’t
always remove the trial, but He covers you through it. The shadow
doesn’t eliminate the sun—it provides protection under it.</li>
<li><strong>Hide IN God, not FROM God.</strong> Running toward shelter
is faith; running from exposure is fear. Bring your shame into the
shadow of grace where it’s covered, not hidden.</li>
<li><strong>Shadow is proof of light.</strong> You can’t have shadow
without a light source. Resting in God’s shadow means you’re closer to
His presence than you’ve ever been.</li>
<li><strong>Dwelling is different from visiting.</strong> Psalm 91
invites you to live in the shelter, not just stop by in crisis. Make
presence your primary residence, not your emergency contact.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="practice-shadow-rest">Practice: Shadow Rest</h2>
<p>Find a quiet place where you won’t be interrupted. If possible, find
actual shade—under a tree, in the shadow of a building, anywhere with a
clear contrast between sun and shadow.</p>
<p>Sit in the shadow. Feel the temperature difference. Notice how the
same sun that would scorch you is now blocked by something
substantial.</p>
<p>Close your eyes and pray:</p>
<p><strong>“God, I’m sitting in shadow right now. Physical shadow. And I
need spiritual shadow too. I need Your covering. Your shelter. Your
wings over me.”</strong></p>
<p>Name what you’re carrying: the shame, the fear, the exhaustion, the
trial that won’t end.</p>
<p>Then pray:</p>
<p><strong>“I don’t understand why You haven’t removed this. But I trust
that Your shadow is enough. Cover me. Shelter me. Let me rest here,
under Your wings, trusting that You’re between me and the
heat.”</strong></p>
<p>Sit there for as long as you can. Five minutes. Ten. Just rest.</p>
<p>Don’t ask for anything else. Don’t problem-solve. Don’t plan. Just
rest in the shadow.</p>
<p>This is what dwelling looks like: choosing to stay in presence even
when the trial isn’t over. Trusting that the shadow is sufficient.</p>

<h3 id="chapter-7-amazing-grace-i-did-receive">Chapter 7: Amazing Grace
I Did Receive</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith— and this is
not from yourselves, it is the gift of God.” — Ephesians 2:8</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>An Invitation to Receive</strong></p>
<p>You’ve walked through six chapters now. You’ve named the swamp, cried
out, decided, died to the old, stepped into the water, and discovered
grace shelters you in the wilderness.</p>
<p>But here’s a question that might make you uncomfortable:</p>
<p><strong>Do you really believe you’re worthy of this? Do you believe
grace is actually for you?</strong></p>
<p>Because if you’re honest, part of you is still keeping score. Still
calculating whether you’ve done enough, been good enough, believed hard
enough to deserve what you’re receiving.</p>
<p>Part of you is still trying to earn it.</p>
<p>And that’s the problem. Because what comes next—what you’re about to
encounter in this chapter—can’t be earned. Can’t be deserved. Can’t be
worked for or achieved.</p>
<p>It can only be received.</p>
<p>Grace is the most offensive word in the language because it says:
“You’re getting this for free, and there’s nothing you can do about
it.”</p>
<p>No performance required. No goodness quota. No earning your way
in.</p>
<p>Just… receiving.</p>
<p>So I need to ask you: <strong>Can you let go of trying to deserve it?
Can you stop calculating your worthiness? Can you simply open your hands
and receive what’s being freely given?</strong></p>
<p>This is harder than it sounds. Because receiving grace means
admitting you’re the kind of person who needs it. Not someone mostly
good who stumbled. Not someone who tried their best. But someone who
absolutely, categorically doesn’t deserve it.</p>
<p>A wretch, in fact.</p>
<p>And grace says: “That’s exactly who this is for.”</p>
<p>Before you continue reading, pause. Consider:</p>
<p><em>Can you say, even if it feels scandalous: “God, I don’t deserve
this. I can’t earn it. I can’t repay it. But I’m opening my hands to
receive it anyway. Amazing grace—for a wretch like me.”</em></p>
<p>That’s the prayer that opens the door.</p>
<p>Because what comes next isn’t about what you’ve done or who you’ve
been. It’s about what Love does for those who don’t deserve it.</p>
<p>Keep reading. Because what comes next might offend you—or it might
save you.</p>
<h2 id="key-themes-2">Key Themes</h2>
<h3 id="the-scandal-of-grace-for-the-undeserving">1. The Scandal of
Grace: For the Undeserving</h3>
<p>Grace is scandalous precisely because it’s for people who don’t
deserve it. If you deserved it, it wouldn’t be grace—it would be
payment. A transaction. You do X, you get Y.</p>
<p>But grace isn’t a transaction. It’s a gift. Freely given to those who
can never earn it, never repay it, never deserve it.</p>
<p>This offends us. Deeply.</p>
<p>Because we’ve been trained to believe you get what you earn. Work
hard, get rewarded. Mess up, face consequences. The world runs on merit,
on fairness, on getting what you deserve.</p>
<p>But grace shatters that entire system.</p>
<p>The Apostle Paul writes in Ephesians 2:8-9:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“God saved you by his grace when you believed. And you can’t take
credit for this; it is a gift from God. Salvation is not a reward for
the good things we have done, so none of us can boast about it.”</p>
<p>— Ephesians 2:8-9 (NLT)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not by works. Not by trying harder. Not by cleaning yourself up
first. By grace. Through faith. A gift.</p>
<p><strong>Want to hear a story that captures this
perfectly?</strong></p>
<p>There’s a story about a prophet named Jonah. He received a clear call
from God: go to Nineveh and call the people to repentance. But Jonah
fled in the opposite direction, boarding a ship to Tarshish. He thought
he could outrun God, create his own path, define his own freedom.</p>
<p>This is our human condition—we hear what’s true, but our hearts are
afraid, prideful, stubborn. We think we know better. We convince
ourselves that our version of freedom will bring fulfillment.</p>
<p>When Jonah fled, he wasn’t seeking freedom—he was seeking autonomy.
Control. The right to write his own story without interference. And that
path led him straight into the belly of a fish, trapped in the very
darkness he’d been trying to escape.</p>
<p>In that belly, in that darkness, Jonah cried out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I cried out to the LORD in my great trouble, and he answered me. I
called to you from the land of the dead, and LORD, you heard me!”</p>
<p>— Jonah 2:2 (NLT)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He didn’t clean himself up first. Didn’t earn the right to be heard.
From the grave of his own making, from the consequences of his own
rebellion, he cried out.</p>
<p>And God answered.</p>
<p>That’s the scandal. God doesn’t wait for us to deserve rescue. He
rescues us while we’re still in the belly of the whale.</p>
<p>Philip Yancey writes powerfully about this scandal:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Grace is the most dangerous, revolutionary, unexpected, and free
force the world has ever seen or will ever see. It is wild and
uncontrollable. When people taste it, they become addicted to it.”</p>
<p>— Philip Yancey, <em>What’s So Amazing About Grace?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Grace is dangerous precisely because it refuses to play by our rules.
It doesn’t wait for worthiness. It doesn’t demand payment. It just
gives—freely, scandalously, outrageously.</p>
<h3 id="trading-true-freedom-for-false-freedom">2. Trading True Freedom
for False Freedom</h3>
<p>The writing from the blog captures this perfectly:</p>
<p><em>“I traded it in for my version of freedom / Ruling others from my
own throne / Instead of following the Master’s plan / I wrote one of my
own.”</em></p>
<p>We think freedom means autonomy. No rules. No boundaries. No one
telling us what to do. We sit on our self-made thrones and convince
ourselves we’re liberated.</p>
<p>But autonomy isn’t freedom. It’s slavery in disguise.</p>
<p>When we attempt to rule our own lives without what’s Real guiding us,
we don’t escape constraints—we just exchange life-giving boundaries for
the soul-crushing bondage of our own making. We become enslaved to our
appetites. Our pride. Our need to control. Our fear of being
exposed.</p>
<p>The freedom we think we’ve found leads us down a dead-end path.</p>
<p>And at the end of that path? A grave. Not physical death necessarily,
but spiritual death. Isolation. Emptiness. The slow suffocation of a
soul trying to live on its own terms.</p>
<p>Real freedom isn’t found in throwing off all restraints. Real freedom
is found in surrender.</p>
<p>Jesus says in John 8:36:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“So if the Son sets you free, you are truly free.”</p>
<p>— John 8:36 (NLT)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not freedom to do whatever we want. Freedom to become who we were
created to be. Freedom from the tyranny of self. Freedom to live in the
flow of love instead of fighting against it.</p>
<p>Timothy Keller captures this paradox:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The Christian gospel is that I am so flawed that Jesus had to die
for me, yet I am so loved and valued that Jesus was glad to die for me.
This leads to deep humility and deep confidence at the same time.”</p>
<p>— Timothy Keller, <em>The Prodigal God</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>True freedom isn’t found in ruling our own throne—it’s found in
bowing before the only One who died to set us free. That’s the freedom
Jonah discovered in the belly of the fish, the freedom that leads us
from the grave to the water’s edge.</p>
<p>The pathway to this freedom is counterintuitive: it requires us to
step off our dead-end road and run toward the very One we’ve been
fleeing from.</p>
<h3 id="from-the-grave-to-the-waters-edge">3. From the Grave to the
Water’s Edge</h3>
<p>The progression in the writing is crucial:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>“The freedom I was living / Turned out to make me a
slave”</em></li>
<li><em>“Rather than bringing life to me / It buried me in my own
grave”</em></li>
<li><em>“He led me down a dead end path / So He could show me His
vision”</em></li>
<li><em>“It stopped way short of the water of life / And I had to make a
decision”</em></li>
</ul>
<p>God doesn’t usually intervene the moment we start running. He lets us
run. Lets the path we’ve chosen reveal its true nature. Lets us reach
the dead end.</p>
<p>Not because He’s cruel. Because that’s when we’re finally ready to
listen.</p>
<p>As long as we think our path might work, we won’t turn around. But
when we hit the wall, when the road dead-ends, when we’re standing in a
grave of our own making—that’s when grace becomes not just nice but
necessary.</p>
<p>And at that dead end, there’s a choice: turn around or stay
buried.</p>
<p>The water of life is right there. Close enough to see. Close enough
to reach. But there’s a gap between the dead-end road and the water’s
edge. And crossing that gap requires a decision.</p>
<p><em>Pause and consider: Where has your self-made path led you? What
dead end are you facing?</em></p>
<p>Will we stay on the familiar path, even though it’s killing us? Or
will we step off into the unknown, trusting that Love will catch us?</p>
<h3 id="the-decision-fleeing-or-embracing">4. The Decision: Fleeing or
Embracing</h3>
<p><em>“Would I turn around and walk away / Fleeing from the water’s
edge / Or would I leave my road and run to Him / Embracing His freedom
pledge”</em></p>
<p>This is the hinge moment. The turning point. Everything comes down to
this choice.</p>
<p>Grace is offered. The water is there. The invitation is extended. But
grace must be received. We have to choose to step toward it.</p>
<p>And here’s what’s so tender about this moment: God doesn’t force us.
He invites. He calls. He stands at the water’s edge with arms open. But
He waits for us to come.</p>
<p>Why? Because love that’s forced isn’t love. Rescue that’s imposed
isn’t freedom.</p>
<p>God wants relationship, not robots. So He offers grace and waits for
our response.</p>
<p>The wayfarer in the story makes the choice: “I stepped off that dead
end road / And simply trusted He would save.”</p>
<p>Notice the word: simply. Not “I cleaned myself up and then
approached.” Not “I proved I was worthy and then stepped forward.”
Simply trusted.</p>
<p>That’s all grace requires. Not perfection. Not performance. Just
trust.</p>
<p>Trust that God is who He says He is. Trust that grace is real. Trust
that the water won’t reject you.</p>
<h3 id="the-lifting-gods-hand-raises-us">5. The Lifting: God’s Hand
Raises Us</h3>
<p><em>“With each step I took, I felt His hand / Lifting me out of my
grave”</em></p>
<p>This is the miracle of grace. We step toward the water, and God’s
hand meets us. We take one step of faith, and He carries us the rest of
the way.</p>
<p>We don’t pull ourselves out of the grave. We can’t. We’re dead in
it.</p>
<p>But when we trust—when we simply turn toward the water and step—God’s
hand reaches down and lifts us out.</p>
<p>Paul captures this in Ephesians 2:4-5:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“But God is so rich in mercy, and he loved us so much, that even
though we were dead because of our sins, he gave us life when he raised
Christ from the dead. (It is only by God’s grace that you have been
saved!)”</p>
<p>— Ephesians 2:4-5 (NLT)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Made us alive. Not “helped us get a little better.” Not “gave us a
boost.” Made us alive.</p>
<p>That’s resurrection language. That’s dead-to-life language. That’s
grace language.</p>
<p>You can’t resurrect yourself. You can only be resurrected. And that’s
what God does when you step toward the water. He doesn’t just wash you.
He raises you.</p>
<p>From death to life. From grave to grace. From wretch to beloved.</p>
<h3 id="addressing-objections-cheap-grace-vs.-costly-grace">6.
Addressing Objections: Cheap Grace vs. Costly Grace</h3>
<p>Whenever we talk about grace being free, unearned, and given to the
undeserving, someone will object: “But doesn’t that make grace cheap?
Doesn’t that give people license to sin?”</p>
<p>Dietrich Bonhoeffer addressed this in his book <em>The Cost of
Discipleship</em>. He distinguished between cheap grace and costly
grace.</p>
<p>Cheap grace is grace without discipleship. Grace without
transformation. Grace that says, “You’re forgiven, so keep living
however you want.” It’s grace as a Get Out of Jail Free card that you
pocket and then go back to your old life.</p>
<p>Costly grace is grace that costs God everything—the life of His Son
on the cross—and costs us everything too. Not to earn it, but as a
response to it. When you truly encounter grace, it doesn’t leave you
unchanged. It transforms you.</p>
<p>Bonhoeffer writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Cheap grace is the preaching of forgiveness without requiring
repentance, baptism without church discipline, Communion without
confession, absolution without personal confession. Cheap grace is grace
without discipleship, grace without the cross, grace without Jesus
Christ, living and incarnate. Costly grace is the treasure hidden in the
field; for the sake of it a man will gladly go and sell all that he
has.”</p>
<p>— Dietrich Bonhoeffer, <em>The Cost of Discipleship</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The grace we encounter at the water’s edge is costly—not in what we
pay to receive it, but in what it cost Christ to offer it, and in how
completely it transforms us when we truly receive it.</p>
<p>Costly grace says: “You’re forgiven, and because of that, you’re free
to become who you were always meant to be. Not by striving, but by
surrendering. Not by performing, but by receiving and then living out of
the abundance of what you’ve received.”</p>
<p>The grace extended at the water’s edge is costly grace. It cost Jesus
His life. And it will cost us our old life—the one built on autonomy and
self-rule. But what we gain in exchange is life itself. Real life.
Abundant life. Eternal life.</p>
<h2 id="the-core-scripture-truth">The Core Scripture Truth</h2>
<p>Here’s the theological bedrock of everything we’re exploring in
Ephesians 2:8-9:</p>
<p>Let’s unpack this verse phrase by phrase, because it changes
everything.</p>
<p><strong>“By grace you have been saved”:</strong></p>
<p>Grace is the means. Not effort. Not goodness. Not trying really hard.
Grace.</p>
<p>And notice the tense: “have been saved.” It’s done. Accomplished.
Complete. You’re not trying to get saved. If you’re in Christ, you are
saved. Present reality, not future hope.</p>
<p><strong>“Through faith”:</strong></p>
<p>Faith is the instrument. The way grace is received. Not works, but
trust. Belief. Reliance on God’s promise rather than your own
ability.</p>
<p>Faith isn’t the same as perfection. You don’t have to have perfect
faith to be saved. You just have to have faith—even mustard-seed-sized
faith—in a perfect Savior.</p>
<p><strong>“And this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of
God”:</strong></p>
<p>This is crucial. Both the salvation and the faith are gifts. You
can’t even take credit for believing. God gives the grace. God gives the
faith. You receive.</p>
<p>Why does Paul emphasize this? Because our default mode is to try to
contribute something. To earn a little bit. To prove we’re worthy. But
grace, by definition, can’t be earned. The moment you think you’ve
contributed to your salvation, you’ve moved from grace to works. And
works can’t save.</p>
<p><strong>“Not by works, so that no one can boast”:</strong></p>
<p>If salvation were by works, then the people who did the most works
would have bragging rights. They’d be “better Christians” than those who
did fewer works.</p>
<p>But in grace, there’s no hierarchy. The apostle Paul and the thief on
the cross stand before God on the same footing: utterly dependent on
grace.</p>
<p>No one can boast. Not about how good they are. Not about how hard
they tried. Not about how much they’ve done for God.</p>
<p>We can only boast in this: Amazing grace, how sweet the sound, that
saved a wretch like me.</p>
<p>Andrew Murray beautifully expresses this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The first link between my soul and Christ is not my goodness but my
badness, not my merit but my misery, not my standing but my falling, not
my riches but my need.”</p>
<p>— Andrew Murray, <em>Abide in Christ</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We don’t come to grace because we’re good enough. We come because
we’re desperate enough. And that desperation—that acknowledgment of our
wretchedness—is the beginning of transformation.</p>
<h2 id="song-integration-4">Song Integration</h2>
<p>The first time I truly understood John Newton’s “Amazing Grace,” I
was standing at a dead end of my own making, and the word “wretch”
suddenly stopped being offensive and started being honest. This isn’t a
song about minor mistakes. This is about moral catastrophe, actively
participating in your own destruction, deserving condemnation and
receiving grace instead.</p>
<p>To understand this hymn, you need to know who wrote it. John Newton
was a slave trader. He commanded ships transporting kidnapped Africans
across the Atlantic in horrific conditions. He profited from human
suffering on an industrial scale. When a violent storm nearly sank his
ship in 1748, Newton cried out to God. That moment began a long
transformation—but even after his conversion, he continued in the slave
trade for years. Only later, after entering ministry, did he become an
active abolitionist, working with William Wilberforce to end the slave
trade in Britain. When Newton called himself a wretch, he wasn’t being
dramatic. He was being factual.</p>
<p>Modern Christianity has a complicated relationship with “wretch.”
Some hymnals have softened it: “that saved and strengthened me” or “that
saved a soul like me.” But the softening misses the point entirely.
Grace only makes sense if we’re honest about what we’re being saved
from. If we’re basically good people who just need a little help, grace
isn’t amazing—it’s redundant. But if we’re wretches—so far gone we can’t
save ourselves, having actively participated in evil—then grace isn’t
just nice. It’s necessary. It’s scandalous. It’s amazing.</p>
<p>The word “wretch” isn’t about self-loathing. It’s about honest
assessment. Romans 3:23 doesn’t say “all have stumbled a little”—it says
“all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.” All. Every single
one. We’re all wretches in need of grace. And that’s good news. Because
if grace is only for the basically good, most of us are disqualified.
But if grace is for wretches, we all qualify.</p>
<p>The original writing from my blog captures the journey: “I traded it
in for my version of freedom / Ruling others from my own throne.” This
is the Genesis 3 temptation: “You will be like God”—the seductive belief
that we can define reality for ourselves, that autonomy is the highest
good. So I took the gifts I’d been given and threw them away for my
version of freedom. And my version of freedom turned out to be slavery.
“The freedom I was living / Turned out to make me a slave / Rather than
bringing life to me / It buried me in my own grave.”</p>
<p>Sometimes God lets us exhaust our own options. He doesn’t intervene
the moment we start running. He lets the path we’ve chosen reveal its
true nature. He lets us hit the dead end. Not because He’s cruel, but
because that’s when we’re finally ready to listen. The dead-end path
isn’t punishment. It’s mercy.</p>
<p>“I stepped off that dead end road / And simply trusted He would save
/ With each step I took, I felt His hand / Lifting me out of my grave.”
<em>Simply trusted.</em> Not “I cleaned myself up and then approached.”
Just trust. That’s all grace requires. Not perfection, not performance.
And the miracle: with each step toward the water, I felt His hand. Not
after I arrived. <em>With each step.</em> He met me in the moving. Grace
active, present, immediate.</p>
<p>The three verses I recorded trace the journey. Verse 1: The
Rescue—“Amazing grace, how sweet the sound / That saved a wretch like
me.” All passive voice—things done <em>to</em> me, not <em>by</em> me.
Grace is the actor. I’m the recipient. Verse 2: The Fear and
Relief—grace teaches holy fear (appropriate awe) and relieves fear
(terror of condemnation). Both. Verse 3: The Testimony—“’Tis grace hath
brought me safe thus far / And grace will lead me home.” Looking back: I
didn’t survive through my own strength. Looking forward: grace
<em>will</em> lead me home. Certainty.</p>
<p>“Amazing Grace” has endured for centuries because we’re all wretches,
and we all need grace. The scandal isn’t just that grace saved me once.
The scandal is that grace keeps saving me—daily, hourly, every time I
turn from the dead-end path and move toward the water’s edge.</p>
<h2 id="reflections-for-the-road-3">Reflections for the Road</h2>
<p>These questions aren’t homework. They’re invitations to encounter
grace personally.</p>
<p><strong>Questions for the Journey:</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Where are you trading true freedom for false
freedom?</strong></p>
<p>What self-made throne are you sitting on? Where are you trying to
write your own plan instead of following what’s true? Be specific. Name
it. Because you can’t step off a path you won’t admit you’re
on.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>What dead-end road has life let you travel to show you
its true nature?</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes we have to exhaust our own options before we’re ready to
receive what’s offered. Where has your path dead-ended? And what is
being shown to you from that vantage point?</p></li>
<li><p><strong>What’s keeping you from stepping toward the water’s
edge?</strong></p>
<p>Is it shame? The belief that you’ve gone too far? The fear that grace
has limits and you’ve exceeded them? Name the obstacle. Bring it into
the light. Because shame loses its power when it’s spoken
aloud.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Read Luke 15:11-32 slowly. Put yourself in the prodigal’s
place. What would it feel like to have the Father run toward
you?</strong></p>
<p>Don’t rush this. Imagine standing far off, still in your filth,
rehearsing your apology. And then imagine seeing the Father—not waiting
sternly at the door, but running toward you with arms open. What would
that do to your heart?</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="closing-image-3">Closing Image</h2>
<p>You’re standing in the water now. Not all the way in yet—just
ankle-deep. But you’re in.</p>
<p>And the water is exactly what was promised. Living. Flowing.
Clean.</p>
<p>The mud from the swamp is starting to wash away. Not all at once, but
gradually. With each step deeper, more of it lifts off and is carried
downstream.</p>
<p>You look down at your feet and you can see them clearly for the first
time in years. The water is so clear you can see straight to the bottom.
And you realize: This is what I’ve been longing for. Not just to be
clean, but to be seen—truly seen—and loved anyway.</p>
<p><em>Take a breath.</em></p>
<p>You cup water in your hands and pour it over your arms. The mud runs
off in brown streams. Underneath: skin. Your actual skin. You’d almost
forgotten what it looked like.</p>
<p>You’re still a mess. You’re still covered in swamp residue. But
you’re also being washed. Both are true at the same time.</p>
<p>And from somewhere deep inside—deeper than the shame, deeper than the
fear, deeper than the old lies—you hear it rising up. Your voice.
Singing.</p>
<p><em>Amazing grace, how sweet the sound, that saved a wretch like me.
I once was lost but now I’m found, was blind but now I see.</em></p>
<p>It’s not just a hymn anymore. It’s your story.</p>
<p>You’re at the water’s edge. You’ve stepped in. And grace is washing
you clean.</p>
<p>One step at a time. One breath at a time. One grace-filled moment at
a time.</p>
<p>You’re being made new. And it’s only just beginning.</p>

<h3 id="chapter-8-dig-a-little-deeper">Chapter 8: Dig a Little
Deeper</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“They will be like a tree planted by the water that sends out its
roots by the stream.” — Jeremiah 17:8</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>An Invitation to Go Deeper</strong></p>
<p>You’ve journeyed through seven chapters now. You’ve named the swamp,
cried out, decided, died to the old, stepped into living water, found
shelter in grace, and received what you don’t deserve.</p>
<p>You’ve been washed. The surface mud is gone. You look better. Smell
better. Function better.</p>
<p>But now I need to ask you something uncomfortable:</p>
<p><strong>Are you willing to let grace go deeper than the
surface?</strong></p>
<p>Because here’s what I’ve learned: Getting clean isn’t the same as
getting healed.</p>
<p>It’s like the sign in the doctor’s office: “Do you want to be right,
or do you want to be well?”</p>
<p>You can wash off the mud and still carry the wounds underneath. You
can look healed on the outside while the infection still festers inside.
You can function well while the scar tissue hides the pain you’ve never
actually dealt with.</p>
<p>Grace doesn’t just want to clean you up. Grace wants to heal you from
the inside out. And that requires digging—opening wounds you’ve spent
years protecting, feeling pain you’ve been numbing, facing truths you’ve
been avoiding.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s the hard truth nobody tells you upfront: You can’t
heal what you won’t feel. And you can’t feel what you keep
buried.</strong></p>
<p>This chapter is about excavation. About going beneath the surface to
the deep places where real transformation happens.</p>
<p>And I’m not going to lie to you—it’s terrifying. It’s going to hurt.
You’re going to want to stop halfway through and just settle for looking
clean on the outside.</p>
<p>But if you’re willing—if you can say, even with fear, “God, I don’t
want to just look healed, I want to BE healed. Dig as deep as You need
to”—then what comes next will transform you from the inside out.</p>
<p><strong>Are you ready to go deeper? To let grace excavate not just
your behavior but your heart? To dig through the scar tissue until you
hit bedrock truth?</strong></p>
<p>If yes, take a breath and keep reading.</p>
<p>This is where transformation stops being surface-level and starts
becoming soul-level.</p>

<p>The Apostle Paul prays one of the most beautiful prayers in Scripture
in Ephesians 3:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“May you have the power to understand, as all God’s people should,
how wide, how long, how high, and how deep his love is. May you
experience the love of Christ, though it is too great to understand
fully. Then you will be made complete with all the fullness of life and
power that comes from God.”</p>
<p>— Ephesians 3:18-19 (NLT)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How wide? Wide enough to reach every person, every nation, every
generation. No one is outside the reach of this love.</p>
<p>How long? Long enough to span eternity. From before the foundation of
the world to forever. This love has no beginning and no end.</p>
<p>How high? High enough to lift us from the lowest pit to the highest
heights. From death to life. From slave to heir.</p>
<p>How deep? This is where it gets personal. Deep enough to reach the
deepest wound, the darkest shame, the most hidden brokenness.</p>
<p>Grace doesn’t skim the surface. It goes all the way down. Down to the
root. Down to the original pain. Down to the place you’ve been
protecting for years because you’re terrified that if anyone—including
God—sees it, you’ll be rejected.</p>
<p>But grace isn’t afraid of your depth.</p>
<p>Grace dives. Grace excavates.</p>
<p>Grace says: “Show me the wound. I know how to heal it.”</p>
<p>Philip Yancey writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Grace, like water, flows to the lowest part. The gospel’s good news
is that God loves us not because of our infinite worth, but in spite of
our infinite unworthiness.”</p>
<p>— Philip Yancey, <em>The Jesus I Never Knew</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Grace doesn’t wait at the surface for us to climb up. It descends—all
the way down to the lowest, darkest, most wounded places.</p>
<p>That’s where grace does its deepest work.</p>
<h3 id="spiritual-formation-as-excavation-not-construction">2. Spiritual
Formation as Excavation, Not Construction</h3>
<p>We tend to think of spiritual growth as building something. Adding
disciplines. Improving behavior. Constructing a better version of
ourselves.</p>
<p>But that’s not how it works.</p>
<p>Spiritual formation is more like archaeology than architecture.
Excavation, not construction.</p>
<p>You’re not building a new self from scratch. You’re uncovering your
true self—the image of the Divine that’s been buried under layers of
wounds, lies, and false beliefs.</p>
<p>Dallas Willard writes in <em>Renovation of the Heart</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Actions are not impostions on who we are, but are expressions of who
we are. They come out of our heart and the inner realities it supervises
and interacts with.”</p>
<p>— Dallas Willard, <em>Renovation of the Heart</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Who you are at the core—created in love’s image, beloved, chosen,
redeemed—is already true. But it’s buried. Hidden under layers of pain
and protection.</p>
<p>Digging deeper means removing what doesn’t belong so the truth can
emerge.</p>
<p>Think of a sculptor chipping away marble to reveal the statue that’s
been there all along. The sculptor doesn’t create the statue from
nothing. The statue is already in the marble. The work is removing
everything that isn’t the statue.</p>
<p>That’s what digging deeper does. It removes the false beliefs, the
protective layers, the scar tissue—not to create something new, but to
reveal what’s always been true underneath.</p>
<p>Thomas Merton understood this deeply:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“There is only one problem on which all my existence, my peace, and
my happiness depend: to discover myself in discovering God. If I find
Him I will find myself and if I find my true self I will find Him.”</p>
<p>— Thomas Merton, <em>The Seven Storey Mountain</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Excavation isn’t just about removing what’s false—it’s about
uncovering who we truly are. The two discoveries are one journey.</p>
<h3 id="digging-through-the-layers">3. Digging Through the Layers</h3>
<p>The journey inward follows a pattern. Not everyone goes through these
layers in the same order, but most of us encounter them:</p>
<p><strong>Layer 1: Performance</strong></p>
<p>On the surface, we perform. We present the version of ourselves we
think will be acceptable. We wear masks. Manage impressions. Work hard
to look good, sound good, appear to have it together.</p>
<p>This is exhausting. Performance is never finished. You can never
rest. Always have to be “on.”</p>
<p><strong>Layer 2: Shame</strong></p>
<p>Underneath performance is shame. The voice that says: “If they really
knew me, they’d reject me. If they saw the real me—messy, broken,
failing—they’d turn away.”</p>
<p>Shame is what drives performance. We perform because we’re ashamed of
what we think people will see if we stop performing.</p>
<p><strong>Layer 3: Wounds</strong></p>
<p>Underneath shame are the wounds. The things that happened to us. The
ways we were hurt, betrayed, abandoned, abused. The traumas, large and
small, that marked us.</p>
<p>Wounds aren’t our fault. They’re what was done to us. But they shape
us. They create patterns of response—fight, flight, freeze, fawn—that
become so automatic we don’t realize we’re doing them.</p>
<p><strong>Layer 4: False Beliefs</strong></p>
<p>Underneath the wounds are the false beliefs. The conclusions we drew
from the wounds about ourselves, about others, about reality.</p>
<p>“I’m not good enough.” “Every statement is a criticism.” “Responses
are always taken the wrong way.” “I have to be intense or I won’t be
taken seriously.” “If I’m not perfect, I’ll be abandoned.”</p>
<p>These beliefs formed in moments of pain. And they’ve been running our
lives ever since.</p>
<p><em>What false beliefs have you been living under? What lies sound
like truth because you’ve heard them so long?</em></p>
<p><strong>Layer 5: Bedrock Truth</strong></p>
<p>All the way down, beneath all the layers, is the bedrock truth:</p>
<p>You are loved. You are worthy. You are enough. You are beloved.</p>
<p>This truth was true before the wounds. It remained true through the
wounds. And it’s true now, underneath all the layers.</p>
<p>Digging deeper means excavating through performance, shame, wounds,
and false beliefs until you hit bedrock. Until you touch the truth of
who you actually are.</p>
<h3 id="finding-treasure-buried-in-the-depths">4. Finding Treasure
Buried in the Depths</h3>
<p>Jesus tells a parable in Matthew 13:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The Kingdom of Heaven is like a treasure that a man discovered
hidden in a field. In his excitement, he hid it again and sold
everything he owned to get enough money to buy the field.”</p>
<p>— Matthew 13:44 (NLT)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The treasure is there. Already in the field. The work isn’t creating
the treasure—it’s finding it.</p>
<p>Once you find it, you’ll give up everything to possess it. Not out of
obligation. Out of joy.</p>
<p>That’s what digging deeper does. It helps you find the treasure
that’s been there all along—your true self, your real identity, the
image of love in you—and once you find it, you’ll gladly let go of
everything else.</p>
<p>The performance? Exhausting. Let it go. The shame? A lie. Let it go.
The false beliefs? Not bedrock. Let them go.</p>
<p>What remains is who you’ve always been, underneath:</p>
<p>Beloved.</p>
<p>Eugene Peterson writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The minute we begin moving away from Scripture to discover the will
of God, we enter the world of guesswork and magic and manipulation. The
Bible is God’s revelation to us, revealing who God is and who we are and
what we are called to do.”</p>
<p>— Eugene Peterson, <em>A Long Obedience in the Same
Direction</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Digging deeper means going back to bedrock truth—not our opinions,
not our feelings, but what reality reveals about who we are. That’s the
treasure buried in the field.</p>
<h3 id="surface-religion-vs.-deep-transformation">5. Surface Religion
vs. Deep Transformation</h3>
<p>Jesus had no patience for surface religion. He called out the
religious leaders repeatedly for their performance—they looked good on
the outside, rotten inside.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“What sorrow awaits you teachers of religious law and you Pharisees.
Hypocrites! For you are so careful to clean the outside of the cup and
the dish, but inside you are filthy—full of greed and self-indulgence!
You blind Pharisee! First wash the inside of the cup and the dish, and
then the outside will become clean, too.”</p>
<p>— Matthew 23:25-26 (NLT)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Surface religion focuses on the outside: behavior, appearance,
performance. It’s about looking good to others.</p>
<p>Deep transformation focuses on the inside: the heart, the motives,
the beliefs that drive behavior.</p>
<p>You can clean up your behavior without touching your heart. You can
look like a “good person” on the outside while still being driven by
shame, fear, and false beliefs inside.</p>
<p>Digging deeper means going to the heart. Letting Love excavate not
just your actions but your affections. Not just your habits but your
desires.</p>
<p>Paul captures this in 2 Corinthians 3:18:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“So all of us who have had that veil removed can see and reflect the
glory of the Lord. And the Lord—who is the Spirit—makes us more and more
like him as we are changed into his glorious image.”</p>
<p>— 2 Corinthians 3:18 (NLT)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Transformation. Not behavior modification. Not surface cleaning.
Transformation from the inside out.</p>
<p>And it comes not from our striving but from beholding. From
contemplating Love’s glory with unveiled faces—no masks, no performance,
just face-to-face encounter with what’s Real.</p>
<p>When we dig deep enough to remove the veils, the transformation
happens. Not because we’re trying harder. Because we’re seeing more
clearly.</p>
<p>A.W. Tozer captures this beautifully:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“What comes into our minds when we think about God is the most
important thing about us… Worship is pure or base as the worshiper
entertains high or low thoughts of God.”</p>
<p>— A.W. Tozer, <em>The Knowledge of the Holy</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Surface religion settles for low thoughts—a manageable concept that
confirms our preferences. Deep transformation requires digging down to
encounter what’s truly Real—infinite, holy, transcendent, and yet
intimately near. When we behold rightly, we cannot remain unchanged.</p>
<h2 id="the-core-scripture-truth-1">The Core Scripture Truth</h2>
<p>Here’s the promise that makes digging possible:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If you look for me wholeheartedly, you will find me.”</p>
<p>— Jeremiah 29:13 (NLT)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>God isn’t hiding from you. He’s not playing games, making Himself
difficult to find so only the spiritually elite can reach Him.</p>
<p>But He is deep. And finding Him requires going deep.</p>
<p>“With all your heart.” Not with half. Not with the surface layer.
With all of it. The whole thing. The wounds and the shame and the false
beliefs and the raw, unfiltered need.</p>
<p>When you seek Him there—in the depths, not just the shallows—you find
Him. And when you find Him, you discover He’s been there all along. In
the deep. Waiting for you to stop protecting yourself long enough to let
Him in.</p>
<p>This isn’t about earning presence by being vulnerable enough. It’s
about discovering that Love’s presence is already there, in the depths,
and the work is removing the barriers we’ve erected to keep it (and
everyone else) out.</p>
<h2 id="song-integration-5">Song Integration</h2>
<p>“Time heals all wounds”—it sounds like truth until you discover
something painful: time doesn’t heal wounds. Time just buries them
deeper under layers of scar tissue until we’ve convinced ourselves we’re
fine when we’re actually just numb.</p>
<p>“Dig a Little Deeper” emerged from that season of excavation—when I
learned you can’t heal what you won’t feel, and you can’t feel what you
keep buried.</p>
<p>My counselor, Dr. Petit, explained it with devastating clarity: “It’s
been said time heals all wounds…yet for the untreated or poorly treated
wound, time will infect then scar. For the unset or improperly set bone,
time will knit then lame.” This is medically accurate. A wound left
untreated doesn’t heal—it becomes infected and forms scar tissue over
the infection. A broken bone left unset knits back together in the wrong
position, leaving you permanently lame.</p>
<p>The same is true spiritually and emotionally. Time doesn’t heal soul
wounds. Proper treatment does. And proper treatment requires
digging—opening the wound, draining the infection, then giving time as
the servant of healing rather than as the supposed healer itself. For
years, I’d been functioning around my wounds rather than healing them. I
looked healed. I sounded healed. But I was just well-rehearsed at
hiding.</p>
<p>The turning point came when my counselor helped me distinguish
between the “reactive self” and the “real self.” After moments when I’d
reacted poorly, he would ask: “What specifically was reactive? Once that
becomes clear, we can explore why that’s a trigger.” That question
opened the door to excavation. Triggers aren’t random. They’re connected
to wounds. To disarm the trigger, you have to heal the wound. But to
heal the wound, you have to open it.</p>
<p>This terrified me. The wound was covered, scarred over. Opening it
meant feeling the original pain again. Meant acknowledging how deep it
went. Meant admitting I wasn’t as healed as I’d been pretending to
be.</p>
<p>The song begins by calling out the platitude: “They say that time can
heal what’s broke, but it just whispers empty hope.” Time as healer is
an empty promise. The pre-chorus captures the breaking point: “I tried
to fake it ’til I made it, but I can’t outrun what’s breaking me.” The
decision to stop running and start digging.</p>
<p>The chorus is theologically crucial: “So I’m gonna dig a little
deeper, down where the hurting hides. Open the scar so grace can reach,
the pain that’s buried deep inside.” We don’t dig just to feel the
pain—we dig so grace can reach what’s been inaccessible. As long as the
wound is buried under scar tissue, grace can’t touch it. But when we
expose it to light and truth, grace can do its healing work. “It’s gonna
hurt, I know it will, and healing starts when I finally feel.”</p>
<p>Verse two introduces the promise that makes excavation possible:
“Truth won’t run, it stands its ground, and mercy whispers through the
sound: ‘You’re not alone, I’m still right here, even in your tears.’”
Presence in the pain. God doesn’t wait until we’re healed to show up. He
meets us in the mess, in the tears, in the raw exposed wound. Not after
them, not despite them, but in them.</p>
<p>The bridge confesses dependence: “I can’t do this on my own, but I
was never meant to be alone.” We can’t heal ourselves. We need divine
help and human help—counselors, friends, community. “You reach into the
mess I’ve made, and call my broken heart by name.” God doesn’t wait for
us to clean up before reaching in. He reaches into the chaos and calls
our hearts by name—identity based not on our wounds but on whose we
are.</p>
<p>The final chorus testifies: “So I dig a little deeper, You meet me in
the pain. You wash my wounds with holy light, and I am whole again. It
hurts, but I can feel again.” The paradox of healing: the pain doesn’t
disappear, but it’s no longer the only reality. God’s presence in the
pain is also real. And presence transforms pain from something that
destroys to something that refines.</p>
<p>Since writing this song, excavation has become a rhythm, not a
one-time event. But I’m no longer afraid of the digging. The deeper I
go, the more grace I find. Time doesn’t heal all wounds. But grace—when
we’re willing to dig deep enough to let it reach us—heals what time
cannot.</p>
<p><strong>Verse 2</strong> The night comes calling like before, I see
those shadows on my door. Every memory wakes again, I feel the weight I
can’t defend.</p>
<p>Truth won’t run, it stands its ground, And mercy whispers through the
sound: “You’re not alone, I’m still right here, Even in your tears.”</p>
<p><strong>Pre-Chorus</strong> I’ve tried to numb it, tried to drown it,
But grace keeps reaching down for me.</p>
<p><strong>Chorus</strong> So I’m gonna dig a little deeper, Down where
the hurting hides. Open the scar so grace can reach, The pain that’s
buried deep inside. It’s gonna hurt, I know it will, And healing starts
when I finally feel. I’m gonna dig, dig a little deeper, ’Til I find my
soul.</p>
<p><strong>Bridge</strong> I can’t do this on my own, But I was never
meant to be alone. You reach into the mess I’ve made, And call my broken
heart by name. You say, “Come and drink from the well that won’t run
dry.” And for the first time, I believe — I’m alive.</p>
<h2 id="key-takeaways-3">Key Takeaways</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Time doesn’t heal wounds—proper treatment does.</strong>
Scars can fool you into thinking you’re healed when you’re just covered
up. Real healing requires excavation, not just waiting.</li>
<li><strong>You can’t heal what you won’t feel.</strong> To heal deep
wounds, you must cut through scar tissue, open the pain, drain the
infection, and let grace reach what’s been buried.</li>
<li><strong>Transformation is excavation, not construction.</strong>
You’re not building a new self—you’re uncovering your true self by
removing layers of wounds, shame, and false beliefs until you hit
bedrock truth.</li>
<li><strong>The deepest truth is your belovedness.</strong> Beneath all
the layers—performance, shame, wounds, lies—is the unchanging reality:
you are loved, worthy, and enough because God says so.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="practice-excavation-journaling">Practice: Excavation
Journaling</h2>
<p>This is hard work. Don’t rush it. Set aside unhurried time—maybe a
whole afternoon or evening. Find a quiet place where you won’t be
interrupted.</p>
<p>Bring your journal. And pray this prayer:</p>
<p><strong>“God, I invite You to excavate. Show me the layers I’ve been
living under. Help me dig through performance, shame, wounds, and false
beliefs until I hit bedrock truth. I trust that Your grace is deep
enough to reach all the way down. Give me courage to not turn away from
what You uncover. And help me know I’m not alone in this.
Amen.”</strong></p>
<p>Then work through these layers, one at a time:</p>
<p><strong>Layer 1: Performance</strong> - How do I perform for others?
What version of myself do I present? - What am I afraid people will see
if I stop performing?</p>
<p><strong>Layer 2: Shame</strong> - What do I believe about myself that
I’m ashamed of? - Complete this sentence: “If people really knew _______
about me, they would _______.”</p>
<p><strong>Layer 3: Wounds</strong> - What are the significant wounds I
carry? (Name them. Be specific.) - How have these wounds shaped the way
I relate to God, to others, to myself?</p>
<p><strong>Layer 4: False Beliefs</strong> - What conclusions did I draw
from my wounds? - What lies do I believe about my worth, my identity, my
belovedness?</p>
<p><strong>Layer 5: Bedrock Truth</strong> - Beneath all the layers,
what is the truth God speaks over me? - What does Scripture say about my
identity?</p>
<p>Write honestly. Don’t edit. Don’t make it sound spiritual. Just
dig.</p>
<p>And when you hit bedrock—when you uncover the truth underneath all
the layers—receive it. Let it sink in. Let it be the foundation you
build on.</p>

<p>“Are you tired? Worn out? Burned out on religion? Come to me. Get
away with me and you’ll recover your life. I’ll show you how to take a
real rest. Walk with me and work with me—watch how I do it. Learn the
unforced rhythms of grace. I won’t lay anything heavy or ill-fitting on
you. Keep company with me and you’ll learn to live freely and
lightly.”</p>
<p>— Matthew 11:28-30 (The Message)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here’s the hard truth: Most of us have been in survival mode so long,
we’ve forgotten there’s another way to live.</p>
<p>Survival is getting through. Transformation is growing into.</p>
<p>Survival is crisis management. Transformation is intentional
cultivation.</p>
<p>Survival asks, “How do I make it through today?” Transformation asks,
“What kind of life am I building?”</p>
<p>In the swamp, survival was the only option. You were drowning—just
trying to breathe, trying to keep your head above water, trying to make
it one more day without completely falling apart.</p>
<p>At the water’s edge, you moved from drowning to breathing. From
desperation to hope. From death to life. But you were still focused on
immediate needs—getting clean, finding healing, experiencing rescue.</p>
<p>But this? This is different.</p>
<p>This is learning to live beyond crisis. To build a life that doesn’t
just react to emergencies but actually grows toward something. To
develop rhythms that sustain you not just in the hard seasons, but in
every season.</p>
<p>This is where transformation happens. Not in the dramatic moment of
crisis or the pivotal encounter at the shoreline, but in the steady,
daily rhythm of learning to walk with God.</p>
<p>You’ve left the swamp. You’ve been washed at the water’s edge. Now
you’re learning what it means to live—really live—in the unforced
rhythms of grace.</p>
<p>And this is where everything changes. Not all at once. But day by
day. Breath by breath. Step by step.</p>
<p>These six chapters don’t offer a program to complete. They offer a
way to walk. A rhythm to learn. A life to live.</p>
<p>Not perfectly. Not without stumbling. But with a new kind of
stability. Because the roots are going deep. The rhythms are becoming
established. The transformation is happening—not in dramatic crisis
moments, but in the steady, daily choosing to walk with grace instead of
against it.</p>
<p><em>Pause and consider: What would it mean to stop surviving and
start thriving? To stop reacting and start cultivating? To stop grinding
and start resting?</em></p>
<p>The swamp taught you honesty. The water’s edge taught you grace. Now
the rhythm teaches you sustainability.</p>
<p>This is where faith becomes a way of life instead of a series of
desperate rescues. Where spiritual life stops being exhausting and
starts being life-giving. Where you discover that grace isn’t just the
emergency intervention—it’s the daily bread. The morning-by-morning
manna. The unforced way of living that doesn’t burn out.</p>
<p>You’ve made it through the swamp. You’ve stepped into the water. Now
you’re discovering what it means to let grace carry you—to live in the
rhythms you were designed for all along.</p>
<p>Welcome to the unforced rhythms of grace.</p>
<p>This is where transformation happens.</p>

<h3 id="chapter-9-unforced-rhythms-of-grace">Chapter 9: Unforced Rhythms
of Grace</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you
rest… Learn from me… and you will find rest for your souls.” — Matthew
11:28-29</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>An Invitation to Rest</strong></p>
<p>You’ve walked through eight chapters now. You’ve named the swamp,
cried out for help, made a decision, let something die, stepped into
living water, found shelter in grace’s shadow, received what you don’t
deserve, and dug deep to let healing reach the wounds.</p>
<p>You’ve experienced dramatic grace. Life-changing encounters. Rescue.
Cleansing. Healing.</p>
<p>But now I need to ask you something important:</p>
<p><strong>Are you exhausted from trying to maintain the
intensity?</strong></p>
<p>Because here’s what happens after the crisis: We try to keep the fire
burning through sheer effort and willpower. We pray longer. Read more.
Volunteer for everything. We assume that sustaining grace requires the
same intensity as receiving it.</p>
<p>And we almost crash again. Different swamp, same drowning.</p>
<p>Here’s what I’ve discovered: <strong>Grace isn’t meant to be lived in
constant crisis mode.</strong></p>
<p>The swamp taught you honesty. The water’s edge taught you grace. But
now? Now you’re learning something that might feel revolutionary—or
maybe even scandalous:</p>
<p><strong>You don’t have to keep performing. You can rest. Even while
you’re working.</strong></p>
<p>This chapter is about the shift from frenzy to rhythm. From desperate
intervention to daily bread. From crisis faith to sustainable
presence.</p>
<p>It’s about discovering that grace offers rhythm—a sustainable way of
walking with God that actually fits with how you’re made. Not
manufactured intensity. Not constant peak experiences. Not exhausting
striving.</p>
<p><em>Unforced rhythms.</em></p>
<p>But here’s the challenge: If you’ve been living in frenzy for
years—and most of us have—rhythm will feel foreign at first. Maybe even
wrong. The guilt will whisper, “Shouldn’t I be doing more?” The fear
will ask, “What if I fall behind?” The comparison will accuse, “Everyone
else seems busier. Am I being lazy?”</p>
<p>So before you continue, pause. Consider:</p>
<p><em>Can you say, even tentatively: “God, I’m tired of running. I’m
willing to learn a different pace. I’m willing to believe that You
delight in me when I’m resting as much as when I’m working. Teach me
Your unforced rhythms.”</em></p>
<p>That’s enough. That willingness opens the door.</p>
<p>Because what comes next isn’t about doing more—it’s about living from
a different place. Not striving toward fullness, but living from
fullness. Not working for rest, but working from rest.</p>
<p>Welcome to the unforced rhythms of grace.</p>
<h2 id="key-themes-4">Key Themes</h2>
<h3 id="from-hype-to-home-the-set-point-theory">1. From Hype to Home:
The Set Point Theory</h3>
<p>There’s a concept in psychology called the “set point” theory of
happiness. It suggests that each of us has a baseline level of
well-being—a natural temperament that’s relatively stable over time.
Good things happen, bad things happen, but we tend to return to our set
point.</p>
<p>Here’s why this matters for understanding grace: Grace doesn’t
promise constant emotional highs. It doesn’t promise that every day will
feel like a mountaintop experience.</p>
<p>Grace offers something better: a stable foundation beneath the
fluctuations.</p>
<p>Not hype, but home. Not peak experiences, but sustainable presence.
Not manufactured intensity, but authentic rhythm.</p>
<p>Think about it: You can have a hard day and still be grounded in
grace. You can feel sad and still be held by God. You can experience
disappointment, frustration, even anger—and still be living in the
unforced rhythms of grace.</p>
<p>Because grace isn’t about eliminating life’s natural ups and downs.
It’s about providing the steady baseline—the set point—from which you
experience them.</p>
<p>I spent years chasing the high. The worship experience that gave me
goosebumps. The prayer time where I felt God’s presence palpably. The
Bible study where everything clicked and I was convinced I’d finally
“got it.”</p>
<p>And then I’d crash. The goosebumps would fade. The presence would
feel distant. The clarity would blur. And I’d think, “I’m losing it. I’m
backsliding. I need to try harder.”</p>
<p>So I’d manufacture the intensity. Force the experience. Push for the
feeling.</p>
<p>And I’d burn out. Again and again.</p>
<p>Until I discovered: Grace isn’t the high. Grace is the home. The
stable foundation. The set point.</p>
<p>Some days are up. Some days are down. But underneath it all, there’s
grace. Steady. Reliable. New every morning.</p>
<p>Henri Nouwen captures this beautifully:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The greatest gift of the spiritual life is to be able to rest in
God’s presence.” — Henri Nouwen, <em>The Return of the Prodigal

<p>Not to perform in God’s presence. Not to achieve in God’s presence.
To rest. This is the home we’re invited into—a place of abiding rest
beneath all the fluctuations.</p>
<h3 id="daily-bread-daily-grace-the-manna-experience">2. Daily Bread,
Daily Grace: The Manna Experience</h3>
<p>When Israel wandered in the wilderness, God provided manna—bread from
heaven—every single morning. But there were rules: gather only what you
need for today. Don’t try to hoard it for tomorrow. Trust that tomorrow
will have its own provision.</p>
<p>When Israel first saw it, they said “Man hu?”—“What is it?” The
question mark. They didn’t recognize God’s provision because it didn’t
look like what they expected.</p>
<p>But day after day, as they gathered it and ate it and were sustained
by it, the question mark changed to an exclamation mark. “This is God’s
provision! This is grace made tangible!”</p>
<p>Living in unforced rhythms means participating in a manna experience:
- You don’t have to figure out next month’s provision today - You just
gather today’s manna - You trust tomorrow will have its own - You don’t
hoard grace; you receive it fresh each morning</p>
<p>This is what Jesus taught His disciples to pray: “Give us this day
our daily bread.” Not weekly bread. Not monthly bread. Daily bread.</p>
<p>Because grace is meant to be received in rhythm—morning by morning,
day by day.</p>
<p>I’m a planner. I want to have the next three months figured out. I
want backup plans for my backup plans. I want to secure tomorrow’s grace
today, just in case God doesn’t show up tomorrow.</p>
<p>But that’s not how manna works. That’s not how grace works.</p>
<p>When Israel tried to hoard manna, it rotted. It bred worms. It
stank.</p>
<p>When I try to hoard grace—when I try to manufacture tomorrow’s
provision today—it does the same thing. It becomes dead religion instead
of living relationship. Performance instead of presence. Anxiety instead
of trust.</p>
<p>The manna experience teaches me: Today’s grace is sufficient for
today. And tomorrow’s grace will come tomorrow.</p>
<p>This is freedom. The freedom to be fully present to today instead of
anxiously trying to control tomorrow.</p>
<h3 id="from-survival-to-thriving-asking-different-questions">3. From
Survival to Thriving: Asking Different Questions</h3>
<p>There’s a fundamental difference between surviving and thriving.
Survival is crisis management. Thriving is intentional cultivation.</p>
<p>In the swamp, survival was the only option. How do I make it through
today? How do I keep breathing? How do I not completely fall apart?</p>
<p>At the water’s edge, you moved from crisis to cleansing. Still
focused on immediate needs—getting clean, finding healing, experiencing
rescue.</p>
<p>But in the unforced rhythms of grace, you’re learning to thrive.
You’re not just reacting to crises anymore. You’re building a
sustainable life. You’re asking different questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What do I want to see MORE of in my life?</li>
<li>What do I want to see LESS of?</li>
<li>What do I want NOT AT ALL anymore?</li>
</ul>
<p>From these questions come projects, goals, plans. Not frantic New
Year’s resolutions that set you up for failure. But grace-paced renewal
that leads to transformation.</p>
<p>MORE: Connection with God. Authentic community. Creative expression.
Rest. Joy. Presence.</p>
<p>LESS: Hurry. Performance. People-pleasing. Comparison.
Distraction.</p>
<p>NOT AT ALL: Shame. Fear-based motivation. Relationships that drain
rather than energize. Commitments that don’t align with my calling.</p>
<p>These aren’t rules. They’re rhythms. Patterns you choose because they
bring life.</p>
<p>And here’s the beautiful thing: When you live from these rhythms long
enough, they stop feeling like discipline and start feeling like desire.
You don’t have to force yourself to rest—you crave it. You don’t have to
remind yourself to be present—it becomes natural.</p>
<p>This is the shift from duty to delight. From obligation to overflow.
From working toward rest to working from rest.</p>
<p><strong>Becoming Real Takes Time</strong></p>
<p>But let’s be honest: this transformation doesn’t happen overnight.
The shift from frenzy to rhythm, from performance to presence, from duty
to delight—it’s gradual. It requires patience with yourself.</p>
<p>Margery Williams captures this beautifully in <em>The Velveteen
Rabbit</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It doesn’t happen all at once,” said the Skin Horse. “You become. It
takes a long time. That’s why it doesn’t happen often to people who
break easily, or have sharp edges, or who have to be carefully kept.
Generally, by the time you are Real, most of your hair has been loved
off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very
shabby. But these things don’t matter at all, because once you are Real
you can’t be ugly, except to people who don’t understand.”</p>
<p>— Margery Williams, <em>The Velveteen Rabbit</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Becoming Real—learning to live in unforced rhythms—means being loved
into authenticity over time. It means:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your rough edges get worn smooth not through self-improvement
programs, but through the daily friction of grace</li>
<li>You get “loose in the joints”—less rigid, more flexible, more able
to bend without breaking</li>
<li>You become “shabby” by the world’s standards—less polished, less
impressive, less concerned with appearances</li>
<li>But you’re Real. Authentic. No longer performing. No longer
pretending. Just present.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is what the unforced rhythms are creating in you. Not overnight
transformation. Not instant perfection. But steady, gentle, persistent
becoming.</p>
<p>You’re being loved into who you actually are. And that takes time. Be
patient with yourself.</p>
<h3 id="jesus-rhythm-the-model-for-sustainability">4. Jesus’ Rhythm: The
Model for Sustainability</h3>
<p>If you want to understand unforced rhythms, watch Jesus. He’s the
master of sustainable spiritual life. He never burned out. Never
collapsed under the weight of ministry. Never lost His connection to the
Father.</p>
<p>How?</p>
<p>Rhythm.</p>
<p>Mark 1:35 captures it perfectly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Before daybreak the next morning, Jesus got up and went out to an
isolated place to pray.”</p>
<p>— Mark 1:35 (NLT)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This wasn’t a one-time event. It was His pattern. His rhythm.
Withdrawal and engagement. Solitude and community. Prayer and action.
Rest and work.</p>
<p>Jesus would pour Himself out in ministry—teaching, healing, casting
out demons, engaging with crowds. Then He would withdraw. To a solitary
place. To pray. To reconnect with the Father. To be refilled.</p>
<p>He didn’t wait until He was empty. He maintained the rhythm.</p>
<p>Engagement. Withdrawal. Engagement. Withdrawal.</p>
<p>Because He lived in this rhythm, He had something to give. Not out of
duty. Not out of obligation. Out of overflow.</p>
<p>This is the model. This is what sustainable looks like.</p>
<p>And notice: Jesus faced immense pressure to skip the rhythm. People
were sick. Crowds were waiting. Disciples were asking questions. There
was always more to do.</p>
<p>But He protected the rhythm. He withdrew even when others wanted more
from Him. He rested even when the need was urgent.</p>
<p>Why? Because He knew: If I don’t maintain the rhythm, I’ll have
nothing to give. And giving from empty isn’t sustainable.</p>
<p>I’ve spent most of my Christian life trying to give from empty.
Leading worship when I was spiritually depleted. Teaching when I hadn’t
spent time with God myself. Serving when I desperately needed rest.</p>
<p>And I wondered why I burned out. Why ministry felt like a burden. Why
I was always exhausted.</p>
<p>Jesus shows a different way. Maintain the rhythm. Withdrawal and
engagement. Empty and refill. Rest and work. Henri Nouwen, who wrote
extensively about this pattern, observed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Without solitude it is virtually impossible to live a spiritual
life. Solitude begins with a time and place for God, and him alone.” —
Henri Nouwen, <em>Making All Things New</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not after you’ve earned it. Not when the work is done. As part of the
work.</p>
<h2 id="the-core-scripture-truth-2">The Core Scripture Truth</h2>
<p><strong>Matthew 11:28-30</strong> - “Come to me, all you who are
weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and
learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find
rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.”</p>
<p>This is Jesus’ manifesto for sustainable spiritual life. Let’s unpack
it slowly:</p>
<p><strong>“Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened”</strong></p>
<p>Jesus’ invitation is not to the strong, the capable, the ones who
have it all together. It’s to the exhausted. The burned out. The ones
carrying loads they were never meant to carry.</p>
<p>If you’re tired—not just physically tired, but soul-tired—you’re
exactly who Jesus is calling.</p>
<p><strong>“I will give you rest”</strong></p>
<p>Not “I will give you more work.” Not “I will give you higher
standards.” Rest. Real rest. Soul rest. The kind of rest that comes not
from escaping responsibility but from living in rhythm with grace.</p>
<p><strong>“Take my yoke upon you”</strong></p>
<p>A yoke is a working tool. Jesus isn’t calling you to quit everything
and retreat from life. He’s calling you to work—but to work in
partnership with Him. To let Him set the pace. To let Him carry the
weight. To work in His strength, not your own.</p>
<p><strong>“Learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in
heart”</strong></p>
<p>The teacher matters. Jesus doesn’t drive you with shame. Doesn’t
demand perfection. Doesn’t measure your worth by your productivity.</p>
<p>He is gentle. Humble. Patient. And as you learn from Him—as you watch
His rhythms, adopt His patterns, live in His pace—you discover a
different way of being.</p>
<p><strong>“You will find rest for your souls”</strong></p>
<p>Not just physical rest. Soul rest. The deep, abiding peace that comes
from living in alignment with how you were made. From walking in the
unforced rhythms of grace.</p>
<p><strong>“My yoke is easy and my burden is light”</strong></p>
<p>Easy doesn’t mean effortless. It means well-fitting. Like a yoke
custom-made for the ox wearing it. Jesus’ way of life fits you. It’s
designed for human beings. It’s sustainable.</p>
<p>Light doesn’t mean weightless. It means right-sized. Not crushing.
Not overwhelming. Bearable. In fact, more than bearable—life-giving.</p>

<h2 id="closing-image-4">Closing Image</h2>
<p>You’re not at the water’s edge anymore. You’ve waded in deeper. And
you’ve discovered something surprising: the water has a current.</p>
<p>Not a violent current that sweeps you away. A gentle current. A flow.
And when you stop fighting it—when you stop trying to control every
movement—you realize the current is carrying you.</p>
<p>This is what the unforced rhythms feel like. You’re not striving
anymore. Not forcing. Not manufacturing spiritual experiences or trying
to prove your worth through exhausting effort.</p>
<p>You’re flowing. With grace. In rhythm.</p>
<p>Some days the water is calm. You float. You rest. You simply be.</p>
<p>Some days the water is active. You swim. You work. You engage. But
even the swimming feels different now. You’re not swimming against the
current, desperately trying to get somewhere. You’re swimming with it,
letting it carry you along.</p>
<p>You look up and see the sun filtering through the water. Streaks of
light. Steady. Reliable. New every morning.</p>
<p>Great is His faithfulness.</p>
<p>You take a breath—deep, full, unforced. And you realize: this is
sustainable. This is how you were meant to live. Not in crisis mode. Not
in frenzy. But in rhythm. In flow. In the unforced rhythms of grace.</p>
<p>Into mindful bliss.</p>

Strong Growth</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“Blessed is the one who trusts in the LORD… They will be like a tree
planted by the water… Its leaves are always green; it has no worries…
and never fails to bear fruit.” — Jeremiah 17:7-8</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>An Invitation to Go Deeper</strong></p>
<p>You’ve discovered rhythm. You’ve learned the unforced way of living.
You’re not in crisis mode anymore, not frantically trying to maintain
impossible intensity.</p>
<p>But now I need to ask you something uncomfortable:</p>
<p><strong>When stress comes, when pressure mounts, when circumstances
get hard—do you still revert to old patterns?</strong></p>
<p>Be honest. Do you still react defensively when criticized? Still
withdraw when hurt? Still carry bitterness longer than you should? Still
struggle with pride, with comparison, with the need to prove
yourself?</p>
<p>Here’s what I’ve discovered: <strong>Rhythms are good. But rhythms
without roots become rote. Practices without depth become
performance.</strong></p>
<p>You need more than sustainable patterns. You need deep foundations.
The kind that reach down to streams of living water and anchor you when
everything else shakes.</p>
<p>This chapter is about what happens underground. The hidden work. The
slow transformation that no one sees but everyone eventually
experiences.</p>
<p>It’s about discovering that you’re not just learning new
habits—you’re becoming a new person. And becoming takes time. It happens
in the dark, unseen, in the patient work of roots going deep.</p>
<p><em>Think of a tree during drought. Surface plants die—they had no
depth, no reserves, nothing to draw from when conditions got hard. But
the deeply rooted? They stay green. Not because they’re stronger or
trying harder. Because their roots have gone deep enough to reach water
others can’t access.</em></p>
<p>That’s what this chapter is about. Not what you look like on the
surface. But what’s happening underground.</p>
<p>Deep roots require putting to death what doesn’t belong: pride,
reactivity, isolation, bitterness. And cultivating what does: humility,
responsiveness, connection, forgiveness.</p>
<p>None of this is impressive. None of this gets applause. None of this
makes for a dramatic testimony.</p>
<p>But it’s everything. Because roots determine what happens above
ground.</p>
<p>So before you continue, pause. Consider:</p>
<p><em>Can you say, even with hesitation: “God, I don’t just want to
look different. I want to BE different. Do the deep work in me—the
underground work, the unseen work. Send my roots down deep until I’m
anchored in You, not in circumstances.”</em></p>
<p>That’s the prayer that opens transformation.</p>
<p>Because what comes next isn’t about impressive growth. It’s about
sustainable depth.</p>
<h2 id="key-themes-5">Key Themes</h2>
<h3 id="the-work-of-putting-to-death">1. The Work of Putting to
Death</h3>
<p>Before roots can go deep into what belongs, they have to let go of
what doesn’t. This is the paradox at the heart of spiritual growth: deep
roots require dying.</p>
<p>There are things that have to be put to death:</p>
<p><strong>Pride</strong> - The need to be right. The compulsion to
prove ourselves. The addiction to being seen, recognized, validated by
others.</p>
<p>Pride keeps roots shallow because it keeps us focused on ourselves
rather than God. We’re constantly comparing, competing, defending,
performing. All that energy goes into image management rather than
transformation.</p>
<p>I’ve spent years defending myself. Explaining myself. Making sure
people understood my motives. And all that defending kept me shallow.
Because I was more concerned with how I looked than with who I was
becoming.</p>
<p>Humility is the antidote. Not self-hatred. But what Paul calls
“considering others more significant than yourselves” (Philippians 2:3).
The freedom to be wrong and still be loved. To lose the argument and not
lose yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Reactivity</strong> - Responding from wounds instead of from
identity. When someone criticizes you, do you react defensively? When
life doesn’t go your way, do you lash out? When you feel threatened, do
you attack?</p>
<p>Reactivity is living from your False Self—the wounded, defended,
self-protective version of you.</p>
<p>Deep roots grow when you learn to respond from your True Self—the
beloved, secure, grounded-in-God version of you.</p>
<p>There’s a space between what happens to us and how we respond. In
that space lies our power to choose. Viktor Frankl called this the
essence of human freedom—the ability to choose our response even in the
most difficult circumstances.</p>
<p>I’ve been working on this for years, and I still fail regularly.
Someone questions my decision, and I immediately get defensive. Someone
misunderstands my motives, and I rush to explain. Someone hurts me, and
I want to hurt back.</p>
<p>But I’m learning. Learning to pause. To feel the reaction without
acting on it. To ask: “Is this coming from my woundedness or from my
belovedness?”</p>
<p>That pause—that space between stimulus and response—is where deep
roots grow.</p>
<p><strong>Isolation</strong> - The temptation to withdraw when things
get hard. To hide your struggles. To pretend you’re fine when you’re
not.</p>
<p>Isolation is the enemy of deep roots. Trees don’t grow in
isolation—they grow in groves, forests, communities where their roots
intertwine with other roots, creating stability and sharing
nutrients.</p>
<p>I’m an introvert. When I’m hurting, my instinct is to withdraw. To
pull back. To process alone. And sometimes that’s healthy. But isolation
as a lifestyle? That’s deadly.</p>
<p>Deep roots require staying connected even when you want to withdraw.
Showing up to community even when you don’t feel like it. Being honest
about your struggles even when it’s scary.</p>
<p><strong>Bitterness</strong> - The nursing of perceived injustices.
The rehearsal of how you’ve been wronged. The keeping of records. The
refusal to forgive.</p>
<p>Bitterness is like poison in the soil. It doesn’t hurt the person
you’re bitter toward—it hurts you. It keeps your roots shallow and
twisted, unable to reach the streams of living water because they’re too
busy clinging to old wounds.</p>
<p>I’ve carried bitterness. Rehearsed conversations with people who hurt
me. Kept score. Built cases. And all that bitterness did was keep me
stuck.</p>
<p>Forgiveness is the answer. Not because what happened was okay. But
because holding onto it gives it power over you.</p>
<p>You release it so your roots can grow deep into grace rather than
staying tangled in grievance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“To forgive is to set a prisoner free and discover that the prisoner
was you.” — Lewis B. Smedes, <em>Forgive and Forget</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Putting things to death is only half the work of sending roots deep.
The other half is actively cultivating what belongs—replacing what dies
with what brings life.</p>
<h3 id="the-work-of-cultivating-what-belongs">2. The Work of Cultivating
What Belongs</h3>
<p>Putting to death is only half the work. The other half is cultivating
what belongs—the virtues, practices, and postures that create conditions
for deep roots.</p>
<p><strong>Humility</strong> - Acknowledging your need for grace.
Admitting you don’t have it all together. Embracing your limits rather
than pretending they don’t exist.</p>
<p>Humility positions you to receive. Pride keeps you on the surface,
performing. Humility sends roots deep, receiving.</p>
<p><strong>Responsiveness</strong> - Acting from your True Self, not
your wounded self. Learning to pause between stimulus and response.</p>
<p>This requires self-awareness—knowing your triggers, understanding
your patterns, recognizing when you’re operating from wounds versus
operating from belovedness.</p>
<p>And it requires spiritual practices—silence and solitude to hear
God’s voice, prayer to seek His guidance, Scripture to renew your mind,
community to hold you accountable.</p>
<p><strong>Connection</strong> - Staying engaged even when vulnerable.
Showing up even when it’s hard. Choosing relationship over
isolation.</p>
<p>I’ve learned this the hard way: I need people. Not perfect people.
Not people who never disappoint me. But people who show up. Who pray for
me. Who tell me the truth in love.</p>
<p>Connection is where roots deepen.</p>
<p><strong>Forgiveness</strong> - Releasing what you can’t control.
Letting go of the need for justice, vindication, or revenge.</p>
<p>Forgiveness isn’t a one-time decision. It’s a daily practice.
Sometimes an hourly practice. You choose to release the offense again
and again until one day you realize it no longer has power over you.</p>
<p>These practices of putting to death and cultivating life create the
conditions for deep roots. And Psalm 1 paints the picture of what a
deeply rooted life looks like.</p>
<h3 id="the-tree-by-streams-of-water">3. The Tree by Streams of
Water</h3>
<p>Psalm 1 paints a picture of flourishing that captures everything deep
roots make possible:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Blessed is the one who does not walk in step with the wicked… but
whose delight is in the law of the LORD, and who meditates on his law
day and night. That person is like a tree planted by streams of water,
which yields its fruit in season and whose leaf does not wither—whatever
they do prospers.”</p>
<p>— Psalm 1:1-3</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice the progression:</p>
<p><strong>Planted, not drifting.</strong> Intentional, rooted, stable.
You’ve been planted by streams—the water’s edge of grace. Now roots are
growing deep.</p>
<p><strong>Streams of water.</strong> The tree doesn’t generate its own
water. It’s positioned by an abundant source. You don’t generate your
own grace. You’re rooted in God’s inexhaustible provision.</p>
<p><strong>Fruit in season.</strong> Not all the time. Not constantly.
In season. This is realistic spirituality. There are seasons of growth,
seasons of fruit, seasons of dormancy, seasons of pruning. Deep roots
don’t guarantee constant productivity. They guarantee sustainable
fruitfulness over time.</p>
<p><strong>Leaf does not wither.</strong> Even in drought—hard seasons
when surface moisture evaporates, when emotions are dry, when external
supports fail—the deeply rooted tree endures. Why? Because deep roots
access water others can’t reach.</p>
<p><strong>Whatever they do prospers.</strong> Not prosperity gospel.
This is organic flourishing. A well-rooted tree naturally prospers
because it’s connected to its source.</p>
<p>Stay rooted. The fruit will come. Not forced. Not manufactured.
Organic. In season.</p>
<p>This picture of the tree by streams of water is beautiful. But here’s
what we need to understand: roots like these don’t grow overnight. They
require something most of us struggle with: time.</p>
<h3 id="roots-take-time">4. Roots Take Time</h3>
<p>Here’s what nobody tells you about deep roots: they take time. Years.
Sometimes decades.</p>
<p>We live in an instant culture. We want microwavable transformation.
Download the app, follow the seven steps, and boom—you’re changed.</p>
<p>But roots don’t work that way.</p>
<p>A tree doesn’t shoot roots thirty feet down in a week. It takes
seasons. Storm after storm. Drought after drought. Year after year, the
roots slowly, steadily go deeper.</p>
<p>And for most of that time, you can’t see the growth. Above ground,
the tree might look unchanged. But below ground, everything is
happening.</p>
<p>This is the hidden work of transformation. The work that happens when
no one’s watching. The work that doesn’t make for dramatic testimonies
because it’s slow, steady, mostly invisible.</p>
<p>I’m fifteen years into this journey. And I’m still discovering
shallow roots. Still finding places where I react instead of respond.
Still uncovering bitterness I thought I’d released. Still learning to
stay connected when I want to withdraw.</p>
<p>But I’m also seeing growth I couldn’t see five years ago. Situations
that would have wrecked me ten years ago now just… don’t. Not because
I’m stronger. Because the roots have gone deeper. I’m accessing streams
I couldn’t reach before.</p>
<p>This is the long obedience in the same direction. This is the slow
work of becoming.</p>
<p>And it’s worth it. Because when the drought comes—and it will
come—deep roots mean the difference between withering and thriving.</p>

bear much fruit, showing yourselves to be my disciples.”</p>
<p>This is Jesus’s teaching on remaining—on abiding. And it’s the
theological foundation for everything this chapter teaches about deep
roots.</p>
<p><strong>“I am the vine; you are the branches.”</strong></p>
<p>The relationship is organic, not mechanical. Not master and servant.
Vine and branches. Living connection. Shared life. The sap that flows
through the vine flows through the branches.</p>
<p>You’re not disconnected from Jesus, trying to imitate Him from a
distance. You’re connected to Jesus, sharing His life.</p>
<p><strong>“If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much
fruit.”</strong></p>
<p>The condition is remaining. Not striving. Not performing. Not
white-knuckling your way to holiness. Remaining. Abiding. Staying
connected.</p>
<p>And the promise is fruit. Not because you’re trying to produce it.
But because life is flowing from the vine into the branches. The fruit
is inevitable when the connection is sustained.</p>
<p><strong>“Apart from me you can do nothing.”</strong></p>
<p>This is both humbling and liberating. Humbling because it reminds
you: you’re not the source. You can’t generate spiritual life through
your own effort.</p>
<p>Liberating because it takes the pressure off. You don’t have to
produce. You just have to remain.</p>
<p><strong>“This is to my Father’s glory, that you bear much
fruit.”</strong></p>
<p>The goal isn’t your glory. It’s the Father’s. When you bear
fruit—when love, joy, peace, patience, kindness grow in you—people see
it and give glory to God.</p>
<p>Not because you’re amazing. Because God’s grace is transforming
you.</p>
<p>This is the theological anchor: remain in Jesus. Let His words remain
in you. And fruit will come—not forced, but organic. Not manufactured,
but received. Not through your effort, but through your abiding.</p>
<p>Deep roots make abiding possible. And abiding makes fruit
inevitable.</p>
<h2 id="psalm-1-nlt">Psalm 1 (NLT)</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Oh, the joys of those who do not follow the advice of the wicked, or
stand around with sinners, or join in with mockers. But they delight in
the law of the LORD, meditating on it day and night. They are like trees
planted along the riverbank, bearing fruit each season. Their leaves
never wither, and they prosper in all they do.</p>
<p>But not the wicked! They are like worthless chaff, scattered by the
wind. They will be condemned at the time of judgment. Sinners will have
no place among the godly. For the LORD watches over the path of the
godly, but the path of the wicked leads to destruction.</p>

<h2 id="reflections-for-the-road-5">Reflections for the Road</h2>
<p><strong>Questions for the Journey:</strong> - What needs to die so
roots can go deep? Where is pride keeping you shallow? Where is
reactivity preventing growth? Where is isolation cutting you off? Where
is bitterness poisoning the soil? - What practices position you by the
stream? Prayer? Scripture? Sabbath? Solitude? Worship? Community? Are
you practicing them consistently? - Where are you trying to manufacture
fruit instead of remaining in the vine? Are you striving to be more
loving? Trying harder to be joyful? White-knuckling your way to peace? -
What does “fruit in season” mean for you right now? Not every season is
fruitful. Some are for growth. Some for pruning. Some for rest. What
season are you in?</p>
<h2 id="closing-image-5">Closing Image</h2>
<p>You’re standing at the base of an ancient tree. Massive. Towering.
Its canopy spreads wide, providing shade for acres.</p>
<p>How long has this tree been here? A hundred years? Two hundred?
More?</p>
<p>You walk closer and place your hand on the trunk. Solid. Rough.
Weathered by countless storms. Scarred by lightning strikes. Marked by
seasons of growth and seasons of pruning.</p>
<p>But still standing.</p>
<p>You look up into the branches. Birds nest there. Squirrels scamper.
Life thrives in the shelter this tree provides.</p>
<p>And then you look down. At the base. Where roots disappear into the
earth.</p>
<p>You can’t see them. But you know they’re there. Reaching deep.
Spreading wide. Anchoring this massive tree so firmly that no storm can
topple it.</p>
<p>The roots are why the tree stands.</p>
<p>This is the invitation: send your roots deep. Not for show. Not for
applause. Not even for immediate fruit.</p>
<p>For stability. For resilience. For sustainable life.</p>
<p>The work happens underground. In the quiet. In the daily practices.
In the sustained rhythms. In the patient trust.</p>
<p>You won’t always see results. You won’t always feel growth. You won’t
always sense progress.</p>
<p>But if you remain—if you keep showing up, keep practicing the
disciplines, keep choosing connection over isolation, keep releasing
bitterness and cultivating forgiveness—the roots will go deep.</p>
<p>And when heat comes, you won’t fear. When drought arrives, you won’t
worry. When storms rage, you won’t be uprooted.</p>
<p>Because your roots—hidden, deep, sustained by streams of living
water—will hold.</p>
<p>Like a tree planted by streams of water. Leaves green. Fruit in
season. Soul strong.</p>
<p>Deeply rooted in the love of God.</p>

<h3 id="chapter-11-redemptions-story">Chapter 11: Redemption’s
Story</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good to accomplish
what is now being done.” — Genesis 50:20</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>An Invitation to See</strong></p>
<p>You’ve been through ten chapters now. The swamp. The water’s edge.
The rhythms. The roots. You’ve experienced rescue, cleansing, healing,
and transformation.</p>
<p>But now I need to ask you something that might change how you see
everything:</p>
<p><strong>What if your story isn’t separate from THE
story?</strong></p>
<p>What if the pain you’ve experienced has context? What if the waiting
has meaning? What if the struggle isn’t random?</p>
<p>Here’s what I’ve discovered: <strong>Your story—the swamp and the
rescue, the breaking and the healing, the death and the rising—follows
the same pattern as every redemption story ever told.</strong></p>
<p>Creation. Fall. Redemption. Restoration.</p>
<p>This isn’t coincidence. It’s the arc of reality itself. The shape of
how grace works. The pattern woven into the fabric of existence.</p>
<p>You’re not just surviving your circumstances. You’re participating in
the grand narrative of redemption that’s been unfolding since before
time began.</p>
<p>This chapter is about seeing your story within God’s story. And when
you do, everything stops being random.</p>
<p>The years in the swamp aren’t just years you lost. They’re the
wilderness—like Israel in the desert, like Elijah in the cave, like
David on the run. Necessary preparation for what comes next.</p>
<p>The water’s edge isn’t just a nice metaphor. It’s baptism. It’s Red
Sea crossing. It’s Jordan River moment. The place where the old dies and
the new begins.</p>
<p>The unforced rhythms aren’t just helpful life hacks. They’re manna in
the wilderness. They’re Sabbath rest. They’re the sustainable pace of
people learning to walk with God.</p>
<p>The deep roots aren’t just personal growth. They’re becoming the tree
of Psalm 1, the vine of John 15, the planting of the Lord for His
glory.</p>
<p>When you see your story within God’s story, you start to live
differently. With purpose. With hope. With perseverance. With
mission.</p>
<p>So before you continue, pause. Consider:</p>
<p><em>Can you say, even tentatively: “God, my story is part of Your
story. The broken chapters, the painful seasons, the years I thought
were wasted—they’re all woven into the redemption arc You’re writing.
Help me see my life through that lens.”</em></p>
<p>That shift in perspective changes everything.</p>
<p>Because what comes next isn’t just about understanding theology. It’s
about seeing your life—all of it—as part of the greatest story ever
told.</p>
<h2 id="stories-of-redemption">Stories of Redemption</h2>
<p><strong>The Redemption Promise in Eden (Genesis 3:15)</strong></p>
<p>The moment sin enters the world, God speaks a promise of
redemption:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your
offspring and hers; he will crush your head, and you will strike his
heel.”</p>
<p>— Genesis 3:15</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the first gospel proclamation—the protoevangelium. Even as
God pronounces the curse, He promises redemption. A seed of the woman
will come who will crush the serpent’s head.</p>
<p>The entire Old Testament is the unfolding of this promise. Through
Abraham, through Isaac, through Jacob, through David—the line is
preserved. The promise is passed down.</p>
<p>Until finally, in the fullness of time, the Seed comes: Jesus, born
of a woman, who crushes the serpent’s head at the cross.</p>
<p>Redemption wasn’t an afterthought. It was promised from the
beginning. John Piper writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The gospel is not a new plan. It is the revelation of God’s eternal
purpose—the mystery hidden for ages but now revealed.” — John Piper,
<em>God is the Gospel</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Before the foundation of the world, God knew. Before sin entered,
redemption was planned. This is the depth of His love.</p>
<p><strong>Joseph’s Story (Genesis 37-50)</strong></p>
<p>Joseph’s story is one of the clearest pictures of “nothing is wasted”
in all of Scripture.</p>
<p>Picture seventeen-year-old Joseph, his father’s favorite, wearing the
coat of many colors that marks him as special. His brothers hate him for
it—hate him for the favoritism, hate him for the dreams he tells about
them bowing down to him.</p>
<p>One day they’re far from home, tending flocks. Joseph comes to check
on them. And they see their chance.</p>
<p>They grab him. Strip off the hated coat. Throw him into an empty
cistern—a dry pit in the ground. They sit down to eat lunch while he’s
calling for help from the darkness below. Then they sell him to passing
traders. Twenty shekels of silver. Their brother, sold like
livestock.</p>
<p>Joseph ends up in Egypt as a slave in Potiphar’s house. He works his
way up, proves himself trustworthy—and Potiphar’s wife notices him. She
propositions him. He refuses. Day after day, she pursues him. Finally,
she grabs his cloak, and when he runs, she uses it as evidence: “He
attacked me!”</p>
<p>Joseph goes to prison. An innocent man, imprisoned for doing the
right thing. For years, he’s there. He interprets dreams for fellow
prisoners—the cupbearer and the baker. He asks the cupbearer to remember
him when he’s released. But the cupbearer forgets. Two more years
pass.</p>
<p>Then Pharaoh has a dream. The cupbearer finally remembers Joseph. And
Joseph is brought from prison to palace in a single day. He interprets
Pharaoh’s dream—seven years of plenty followed by seven years of famine.
Pharaoh puts him in charge of preparing Egypt for the coming crisis.</p>
<p>The pit led to Potiphar’s house. The prison led to the palace. And
ultimately, Joseph’s position saves not just Egypt, but his own
family—the very brothers who betrayed him—when they come begging for
food during the famine.</p>
<p>When his brothers finally recognize him and fear his revenge, Joseph
speaks words that capture the heart of redemption:</p>
<p>“You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good to accomplish
what is now being done, the saving of many lives” (Genesis 50:20).</p>
<p>What others meant for evil, God meant for good. What looked like
wasted years—slavery, false accusation, imprisonment—became the
preparation for his purpose.</p>
<p>Nothing—not one moment of suffering—was wasted in God’s economy.</p>
<p><strong>Peter’s Denial and Restoration (Luke 22:31-32; John
21:15-19)</strong></p>
<p>Earlier that same night, Jesus had warned him: “Simon, Simon, Satan
has asked to sift all of you as wheat. But I have prayed for you, Simon,
that your faith may not fail. And when you have turned back, strengthen
your brothers” (Luke 22:31-32).</p>
<p>Peter had protested: “Lord, I’m ready to go with you to prison and to
death!” But Jesus knew better: “Before the rooster crows today, you will
deny three times that you know me.”</p>
<p>Hours later, it happens. Jesus is arrested. Peter follows at a
distance to the high priest’s courtyard. It’s cold. A fire burns in the
center. People are gathered around it for warmth. Peter stands with
them, trying to blend in, trying to stay close to Jesus without being
identified as one of His followers.</p>
<p>A servant girl looks at him in the firelight. “This man was with
him.”</p>
<p>Peter’s response is immediate: “Woman, I don’t know him.”</p>
<p>A little later, someone else sees him: “You also are one of
them.”</p>
<p>“Man, I am not!”</p>
<p>About an hour passes. Peter is still there, still trying to remain
anonymous. Another person insists: “Certainly this fellow was with him,
for he is a Galilean.”</p>
<p>Peter replies with emphasis: “Man, I don’t know what you’re talking
about!”</p>
<p>Immediately, while he’s still speaking, the rooster crows. And at
that moment, Jesus—being led past—turns and looks at Peter. Their eyes
meet across the courtyard. And Peter remembers the prediction. He goes
outside and weeps bitterly.</p>
<p>The enemy’s attack was real. Satan sifted Peter. The denial
happened—three times, just as Jesus said it would.</p>
<p>But Jesus’ prayer was more powerful than Satan’s sifting.</p>
<p>After the resurrection, Jesus finds Peter fishing on the Sea of
Galilee. They cook breakfast on the beach. And Jesus restores
Peter—three questions mirroring the three denials, three affirmations of
love, three commissions to feed His sheep.</p>
<p>“Simon son of John, do you love me?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.”</p>
<p>“Feed my lambs.”</p>
<p>Three times Jesus asks. Three times Peter answers. Three times Jesus
commissions him.</p>
<p>The threefold denial is answered with threefold restoration. The
damage is redeemed. The enemy’s attack is reversed.</p>
<p>The devil’s goal was to destroy Peter. But Jesus’ goal was to
strengthen him through the trial. And Jesus won.</p>
<p>This is always the pattern: the enemy means it for harm, but God uses
it for good. The devil attacks, but Christ restores. The accuser
condemns, but the Advocate defends.</p>
<p><strong>Paul’s Transformation (Acts 9; 1 Timothy
1:12-16)</strong></p>
<p>Paul’s story is violence transformed into mission.</p>
<p>Before his conversion, he’s Saul of Tarsus, a rising star among the
Pharisees. He’s breathing out murderous threats against the Lord’s
disciples. He goes to the high priest and asks for letters to the
synagogues in Damascus—authorization to hunt down Christians, arrest
them, and bring them back to Jerusalem in chains.</p>
<p>He’s on fire with religious zeal. He stood there approving when they
stoned Stephen, the first Christian martyr. He enters house after house
in Jerusalem, dragging men and women off to prison. And now he’s taking
his campaign on the road.</p>
<p>But on the road to Damascus, about noon, a light from heaven suddenly
flashes around him—brighter than the sun. He falls to the ground. And he
hears a voice:</p>
<p>“Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?”</p>
<p>“Who are you, Lord?”</p>
<p>“I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.”</p>
<p>The one he’s been hunting is hunting him. The one he thought was dead
is very much alive. And in that moment, everything Saul thought he knew
shatters.</p>
<p>Jesus tells him to go into Damascus and wait for instructions. Saul
gets up from the ground, but when he opens his eyes, he can’t see. His
companions have to lead him by the hand into the city. For three days,
he’s blind. He doesn’t eat. Doesn’t drink. Just sits in the darkness,
his entire worldview collapsing and rebuilding.</p>
<p>Then Jesus sends a disciple named Ananias to him. Ananias is
terrified—he’s heard about Saul. But he obeys. He lays hands on Saul,
and immediately something like scales falls from Saul’s eyes. He can see
again. And he’s baptized.</p>
<p>The persecutor becomes the apostle. The one who tried to destroy the
church becomes the one who builds it across the Roman Empire. The
murderer becomes the missionary.</p>
<p>Paul never forgets his past. But he sees it redeemed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I was once a blasphemer and a persecutor and a violent man… But I
was shown mercy… so that in me, the worst of sinners, Christ Jesus might
display his immense patience as an example for those who would
believe.”</p>
<p>— 1 Timothy 1:13-16</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His worst moments become testimonies to God’s greatest grace. Nothing
wasted.</p>
<h2 id="the-wayfarer-moment-3">The Wayfarer Moment</h2>
<p><strong>Seeing my story in THE story.</strong></p>
<p>For years, I thought my story was just mine. My struggles. My
failures. My small attempts to get it right.</p>
<p>I’d read the Bible as ancient history—good for principles, maybe, but
not personally connected to my everyday life.</p>
<p>But then I started to see it.</p>
<p>The pattern of my life—swamp, water’s edge, dying, rising, rhythms,
roots—wasn’t unique to me. It was the redemption arc. The same arc that
runs through Scripture from Genesis to Revelation.</p>
<p>I wasn’t just struggling with personal sin. I was experiencing the
fall.</p>
<p>I wasn’t just crying out for help. I was participating in the pattern
of cry and divine response that echoes through the Psalms.</p>
<p>I wasn’t just encountering grace. I was meeting the same God who met
Moses, David, Peter, Paul.</p>
<p>I wasn’t just dying to self. I was being united with Christ in His
death and resurrection.</p>
<p>My story was part of THE story.</p>
<p>And when I saw that—really saw it—everything changed.</p>
<p>The pain I’d experienced wasn’t meaningless. It was part of the
redemption arc. God was using it to conform me to Christ’s image, to
prepare me for the role I’d play in His kingdom.</p>
<p>The waiting seasons weren’t wasted. They were necessary parts of the
story. Times of preparation. Seasons of root-deepening. Wilderness
experiences that would later become testimonies.</p>
<p>The failures I’d carried with shame weren’t the end of my story. They
were chapters in a larger redemption narrative. Like Peter’s denial.
Like Paul’s persecution. Like Joseph’s pit.</p>
<p>God was redeeming them, transforming them into testimonies of
grace.</p>
<p>The wayfarer moment came when I stopped seeing my life as
disconnected events and started seeing it as a coherent narrative—my
story woven into God’s story.</p>
<p>I’m not the author. I’m a character. But I’m a beloved character in a
story written by a good Author who knows how to turn crucifixions into
resurrections.</p>
<p>I don’t know how my particular story will unfold. I don’t know what
chapters are ahead.</p>
<p>But I know the Author. I know the arc. I know the ending.</p>
<p>Creation. Fall. Redemption. Restoration. Consummation.</p>
<p>And I know that in all things—ALL things—God is working for good.
Nothing is wasted. Every pain has purpose. Every struggle is part of the
redemption arc.</p>
<p>This is THE story. And by grace, it’s my story too.</p>
<h2 id="song-integration-6">Song Integration</h2>
<p>For years, my life felt like disconnected pieces. Random events.
Unrelated struggles. Pain here, joy there, failure in one season, growth
in another—but no coherent thread tying it all together.</p>
<p>I looked at my story and saw chaos. Mistakes I couldn’t undo. Seasons
that felt wasted. Suffering that seemed meaningless.</p>
<p>Questions haunted me: Why did that relationship fail? Why did I waste
those years in the swamp? Why did God allow that betrayal? What was the
point of all that pain?</p>
<p>I was so focused on my own story—my struggles, my failures, my
journey—that I’d lost sight of THE story. The grand narrative of
redemption that’s been unfolding since before the foundation of the
world.</p>
<p>The turning point came during a season of deep study. I began to see
the Bible not as a collection of disconnected morality tales, but as one
coherent story with a single redemption arc.</p>
<p>Creation → Fall → Israel → Incarnation → Cross &amp; Resurrection →
Church → Consummation.</p>
<p>And slowly—painfully slowly—I began to see: my story wasn’t random.
It was part of THE story.</p>
<p>The pain I’d experienced? Part of the redemption arc—God conforming
me to Christ’s image through suffering.</p>
<p>The waiting seasons? Not wasted, but necessary. Wilderness
experiences preparing me for what was ahead.</p>
<p>The failures? Like Peter’s denial. Like Paul’s persecution. Like
Joseph’s pit. God was redeeming them, weaving them into a larger
narrative of grace.</p>
<p>This song is my attempt to tell THE story. Not just the cross (though
the cross is central). The whole story. From creation through
consummation. The full redemption arc.</p>
<p>I wanted to trace redemption history chronologically—from “before the
stars” through Eden, through the prophets, through Mary’s baby boy,
through the cross, to the promise of standing before His throne.</p>
<p>And when you see your story within that larger story, everything
changes.</p>
<p>Where my life felt chaotic, THE story reveals purpose. Where my pain
felt meaningless, THE story reveals redemption. Where my failures felt
final, THE story reveals resurrection.</p>
<p>I don’t know how all the pieces of my story fit together yet. I don’t
see the full picture.</p>
<p>But I know the Author. I know the arc. I know the ending.</p>
<p>Creation. Fall. Redemption. Restoration. Consummation.</p>
<p>And by grace—scandalous, undeserved, transforming grace—my story is
part of THE story.</p>

God’s story. You’ve discovered purpose, rhythm, depth.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>When you look back at your life—really look back—what do you
see?</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Be honest. Do you see years in that toxic relationship? The job you
stayed at too long because you were too afraid to leave? The ministry
that blew up spectacularly? The friendships you let die because you were
too proud? The opportunities you missed?</td>

where nothing good grew. Nothing valuable was learned. Just… waste?</td>

scandalous truth that changes how you see your entire timeline.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>## Key Themes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>### 1. Timeline Reflection: The Sacred Work of Looking Back</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Part of believing nothing is wasted is doing the hard work of
timeline reflection. Not to dwell in the past, but to understand how the
past has shaped the present.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>This isn’t nostalgia. It’s not rumination. It’s the intentional
practice of asking: - What moments brought joy? - What moments brought
pain? - What patterns emerged? - Where was grace at work even when I
couldn’t see it?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>I’ve done this exercise multiple times over the years. Drew my
timeline. Marked the major seasons—the joyful ones and the painful ones.
The seasons of growth and the seasons of wandering.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>And every time, I discover the same thing: grace was present even
when I couldn’t feel it. God was working even when I couldn’t see
it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The years I thought were wasted? They taught me what I couldn’t
learn anywhere else. My desperate need for grace. Compassion for others
who struggle. The cost of pride and the beauty of humility.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Even the wasted years became the very years that prepared me for the
work I’m doing now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Timeline reflection requires courage. It means looking honestly at
seasons you’d rather forget. But it also reveals something profound:
grace threads through every season. Even the dark ones.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The thread of redemption. The thread that says: nothing is
wasted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>### 2. Abraham and Isaac on Mount Moriah: The Test That Reveals</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The story in Genesis 22 is one of the most challenging in all of
Scripture. God asks Abraham to offer his son Isaac—the son of promise,
the one through whom all nations would be blessed—as a sacrifice.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Abraham obeys. He takes Isaac up Mount Moriah. He builds the altar.
He binds his son. He raises the knife.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>And God provides a ram in the thicket. Isaac is spared. The promise
is preserved.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&gt; “Abraham named the place Yahweh-Yireh (which means ‘the LORD
will provide’). To this day, people still use that name as a proverb:
‘On the mountain of the LORD it will be provided.’” &gt; &gt; — Genesis
22:14 (NLT)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>What could have been the most tragic waste—the death of the promised
son—becomes instead a revelation of God’s character. The Lord provides.
Always. Even when it seems impossible.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>This is the promise for you: God specializes in last-minute
provision. In eleventh-hour intervention. In turning what looks like
absolute waste into absolute redemption.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The test itself wasn’t wasted. The fear wasn’t wasted. The faith
required to obey wasn’t wasted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>All of it became part of the story that would be told for
generations: on the mountain of the Lord, it will be provided.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>And in your life, the seasons that felt like tests—the moments when
you had to let go of what you loved most, when you had to trust God with
impossible outcomes—those weren’t wasted either.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>They were the ground where provision came. Where faith grew. Where
you learned that God really does provide.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>### 3. Romans 8:28 Rightly Understood</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Perhaps no verse is more quoted—and more misunderstood—than Romans
8:28:</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&gt; “And we know that in all things God works for the good of those
who love him, who have been called according to his purpose.”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>This doesn’t mean everything that happens is good. It doesn’t mean
God causes evil so good can result. It doesn’t mean we should minimize
pain by slapping a spiritual Band-Aid on it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>What it does mean is this: God is relentlessly committed to
redeeming every moment of your story. Even the worst ones. Even the ones
that feel utterly wasted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>God is at work, weaving them into something good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Not always good you can see in the moment. Sometimes not good you’ll
see in this lifetime. But good nonetheless. Eternal good. The kind of
good that redeems every wasted season and makes it count for
eternity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>I held this verse at arm’s length for years. Because it felt like a
platitude. Like minimizing real pain with Christian clichés.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>But it’s not a platitude. It’s a promise. A promise that your pain
has purpose. Your suffering isn’t random. Your struggles aren’t
wasted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>God is working—actively, intentionally, lovingly—to bring good from
it all.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&gt; “God wastes nothing—not even sin. The soul that has struggled
and come through is enriched by its struggle, and the grace of God is
not frustrated.” &gt; — Evelyn Underhill, <em>The Spiritual
Life</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>### 4. Suffering to Compassion: The Transformation</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>One of the most profound ways God ensures nothing is wasted is by
transforming our suffering into compassion. What once wounded us becomes
the very thing that equips us to heal others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&gt; “Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the
Father of compassion and the God of all comfort, who comforts us in all
our troubles, so that we can comfort those in any trouble with the
comfort we ourselves receive from God.” &gt; &gt; — 2 Corinthians
1:3-4</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Your pain isn’t wasted when it becomes the bridge to someone else’s
healing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Your struggle isn’t wasted when it becomes the testimony that gives
someone else hope.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Your scars aren’t wasted when they become the proof that wounds can
heal.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>I’ve seen this in my own life. The years I spent in the swamp? They
weren’t wasted. Because now when someone else is drowning, I can sit
with them in the muck and say, “I’ve been here. I know this place. And
there’s a way out.”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The toxic relationships I stayed in too long? They taught me about
codependency, about people-pleasing, about the cost of losing yourself.
And now I can help others recognize those patterns before the damage
goes as deep.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The ministry position that blew up? It taught me about burnout,
about the danger of deriving identity from what you do instead of who
you are. And now I can warn others away from that cliff.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Nothing is wasted because every experience—even the painful ones—can
become a gift to others.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The years you thought were lost become the very years that qualify
you to speak into someone else’s lostness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The seasons you thought were wasted become the seasons that prepare
you for kingdom work.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>### 5. Counting the Cost: Present and Future</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Timeline reflection looks backward. But the work of “nothing is
wasted” also requires looking forward—counting the cost of present
choices.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>This isn’t just about past choices and their consequences. It’s
about present ones.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>What kind of life do I want to live now? What brings me life? What
drains me? Am I pursuing what’s actually fulfilling, or just what’s
familiar?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>These questions themselves are grace—invitations to live more
intentionally, more authentically, more aligned with who God is calling
you to become.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Counting the cost means asking: If my future self could speak to me
today, what would they want me to know? What choices would they be
grateful I made? What patterns would they wish I’d broken sooner?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>This isn’t anxiety about the future. It’s wisdom. It’s stewarding
today in light of tomorrow. It’s believing that even this moment—this
choice, this breath, this step—matters eternally.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Nothing wasted means: this day counts. This conversation counts.
This choice counts. Because God is redeeming not just your past, but
your present and future too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>## The Core Scripture Truth</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Genesis 22:14</strong> - “So Abraham called the name of that
place, ‘The Lord will provide’; as it is said to this day, ‘On the mount
of the Lord it shall be provided.’”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Romans 8:28</strong> - “And we know that in all things God
works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according
to his purpose.”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>These two passages—separated by centuries—speak the same truth: God
is in the business of redemption. Of provision. Of ensuring that nothing
is wasted in His hands.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Genesis 22 shows us God’s character: He is the God who provides.
Even when the test is unbearable. Even when obedience seems to
contradict the promise. Even at the last possible moment. God
provides.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Romans 8 shows us God’s commitment: He works all things—not some
things, but all things—for the good of those who love Him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>This isn’t wishful thinking. It’s covenant faithfulness. God has
bound Himself to redeem your story, no matter how broken the
chapters.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Together, these passages form the theological foundation for
believing nothing is wasted:</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>God’s provision is certain.</strong> On the mountain of the
Lord—in your darkest moments, your most desperate situations—provision
will be made. It may not come when you expect. It may not look like you
imagined. But it will come.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>God’s redemption is comprehensive.</strong> All things. Not
just the good things. Not just the spiritual things. All things. Every
moment, every experience, every pain, every struggle—God is working it
for good.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>This doesn’t mean the pain wasn’t real. It doesn’t mean the waste
didn’t hurt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>It means God specializes in turning waste into wonder. Ashes into
beauty. Mourning into dancing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>In the economy of God, nothing is wasted. Each tear, each failure,
each loss becomes an opportunity for grace.</td>
</tr>

understand You are good… and nothing is wasted You are near when I let
go You are strong when I feel low You are kind… and nothing is wasted

stayed… and nothing is wasted So I’ll trust You in the silence I’ll
believe You through the dark You are faithful in the waiting You are
healing every part I won’t fear what comes tomorrow I won’t chase what’s

</tr>
<tr>
<td>## Reflections for the Road</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Questions for the Journey:</strong> - What season of your
life feels most “wasted”? Name it. Where do you carry the most regret? -
Do timeline work: Map your life in seasons. Mark the major ones—joyful
and painful. Where do you see patterns? Where do you see the thread of
grace? - What suffering in your life might God want to transform into
compassion for others? Where have you been wounded? How might that pain
become the bridge to someone else’s healing? - Read Genesis 22 and
Romans 8:28 slowly. What is God saying to you about provision and
redemption?</td>

</tr>

<td><em>You’re not really forgiven. God’s still angry. You’ve failed too

<tr>
<td>### 1. Fighting From Victory, Not For Victory</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>This is the fundamental shift. And it changes everything.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>When you’re fighting for victory, every battle feels desperate.
Every temptation is a potential defeat. Every accusation carries the
weight of judgment. You’re trying to earn something, prove something,
secure something through your effort.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>But when you’re fighting from victory, the pressure’s off. You’re
not trying to earn freedom—you’re protecting freedom that’s already
yours. You’re not hoping to overcome—you’re standing in the overcoming
power of Christ.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>James 4:7: “Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Notice what it doesn’t say. It doesn’t say “fight the devil until
you’re exhausted, and maybe he’ll leave.”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>It says resist, and he will flee. Automatic. Guaranteed. The fleeing
isn’t something you make happen—it’s the result of your
positioning.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>You resist, and he runs. Every time.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Why? Because he’s already defeated. And he knows it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>You’re not fighting to win. Christ won. You’re enforcing that win.
Standing in that victory. And when you do, the enemy has no choice but
to flee.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>C.S. Lewis explains the Christian’s unique position:</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&gt; “The Christian is in a different position from other people who
are trying to be good. They hope, by being good, to please God if there
is one; or—if they think there is not—at least they hope to deserve
approval from good men. But the Christian thinks any good he does comes
from the Christ-life inside him.” &gt; — C.S. Lewis, <em>Mere
Christianity</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>We’re not fighting in our own strength. We’re fighting from Christ’s
strength already at work in us.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>### 2. The Lies of the Enemy vs. The Truth of Grace</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The devil’s primary weapon isn’t force—it’s deception. He can’t take
your salvation. He can’t reverse what Christ has done. But he can lie to
you about it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>And if he can get you to believe the lies, he can render you
ineffective.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>His strategy is always the same: make you doubt who you are in
Christ.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><em>“You’re not really forgiven.”</em> <em>“God is still angry with
you.”</em> <em>“You’ve failed too many times.”</em> <em>“You’ll never be
free.”</em> <em>“This sin is too big for grace.”</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Lies. All of them. But lies that feel true when you’re in the swamp,
when you’re struggling, when you can’t see clearly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The antidote is truth. Not just knowing it intellectually, but
anchoring your identity in it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>You are forgiven—completely, fully, eternally:</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&gt; “But if we confess our sins to him, he is faithful and just to
forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all wickedness.” &gt; — 1
John 1:9 (NLT)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>God is not angry with you—His wrath was satisfied at the
cross:</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&gt; “Therefore, since we have been made right in God’s sight by
faith, we have peace with God because of what Jesus Christ our Lord has
done for us.” &gt; — Romans 5:1 (NLT)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Your failures don’t define you—Christ’s righteousness
does:</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&gt; “For God made Christ, who never sinned, to be the offering for
our sin, so that we could be made right with God through Christ.” &gt; —
2 Corinthians 5:21 (NLT)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>You are free—the chains are broken, the prison door is open (John
8:36). No sin is too big for grace—grace is bigger than all of them
combined (Romans 5:20).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>When you stand in these truths, the lies lose their power. The
accusations fall flat. The enemy has nothing to work with.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Because truth always defeats lies. And grace always trumps
accusation.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>A.W. Tozer offers a sobering reminder:</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&gt; “The devil is a better theologian than any of us and is a devil
still.” &gt; — A.W. Tozer, <em>The Knowledge of the Holy</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The enemy knows Scripture. He knows theology. But knowledge without
submission is worthless. We don’t defeat him with superior arguments—we
defeat him by standing in the truth of who we are in Christ.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>### 3. Colossians 2:15 – The Public Spectacle</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>One of the most powerful verses about spiritual warfare is
Colossians 2:15:</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&gt; “And having disarmed the powers and authorities, he made a
public spectacle of them, triumphing over them by the cross.”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>This is the picture: Jesus on the cross, seemingly defeated. The
enemy celebrating. But in that moment of apparent defeat, Jesus is
actually stripping the enemy of every weapon, every claim, every
authority.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>And then—resurrection. The ultimate reversal. Death swallowed up in
victory. The grave defeated. Satan disarmed. A public spectacle made of
all the powers of darkness.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Disarmed. Every weapon the enemy had—sin, death, condemnation,
accusation—was stripped away. He has no legitimate claim. No legal
ground. No authority.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Public spectacle. The victory wasn’t secret or private. It was
public. Visible. Undeniable. The powers of darkness were put on
display—defeated, humiliated, powerless.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Triumphing. This is the language of a victory parade. Jesus didn’t
just win—He celebrated. The cross wasn’t Plan B. It was the plan. And it
worked perfectly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>This is why the devil is on the run. He has no authority anymore.
His power was stripped at the cross. His claims were nullified in the
resurrection. All he has left are lies and fear—and both crumble in the
presence of truth and faith.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Charles Stanley identifies the enemy’s real strategy:</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&gt; “Satan’s primary objective is not to lead you into a blatant
sin. It’s to get you to live independently of God.” &gt; — Charles
Stanley, <em>When the Enemy Strikes</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>This is the core battle. Not spectacular moral failures, but subtle
independence. Living like you don’t need God. Making decisions without
Him. Trusting yourself instead of Him. This is where the real warfare
happens.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>### 4. The Danger of Giving the Enemy Too Much Credit</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>There’s a danger on the other side of spiritual warfare: giving the
devil too much credit. Making him seem more powerful than he is. Living
in constant fear of his schemes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>But the truth is, the devil is a defeated foe. He’s on a leash. His
time is limited. His power is broken. And he has no authority over those
who are in Christ.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>This doesn’t mean we ignore spiritual warfare. It means we engage it
from the right posture—not fear, but confidence. Not paranoia, but
awareness. Not obsession with the enemy, but focus on Christ.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Some Christians see a demon behind every bush. Others deny the
reality of spiritual warfare altogether. The truth is in the middle: the
enemy is real, but he’s already defeated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>We need to be aware, but not afraid. Alert, but not anxious.
Resisting, but resting in Christ’s victory.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The devil is on the run. That’s the truth. But don’t spend your life
looking over your shoulder for him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Keep your eyes on Jesus. Stand firm in truth. And when the enemy
shows up with his lies and accusations, resist him with
confidence—knowing that he has no choice but to flee.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>### 5. Walking in Freedom, Not Just Fighting for It</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The ultimate goal of understanding spiritual warfare isn’t just to
fight better—it’s to walk in freedom. To live in the victory that Christ
has won. To stop constantly battling and start consistently
abiding.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Too many Christians spend their entire lives in spiritual warfare
mode—always fighting, always resisting, always on guard. And while
vigilance is important, it’s not the whole picture.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The whole picture is this: Christ has set you free. The chains are
broken. The prison door is open. The devil is defeated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Your job isn’t to keep fighting for that freedom. It’s to walk in
it. To live from it. To let it shape how you think, how you respond, how
you engage with life.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Galatians 5:1: “It is for freedom that Christ has set us free. Stand
firm, then, and do not let yourselves be burdened again by a yoke of
slavery.”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Stand firm in freedom. Don’t go back to slavery. Don’t pick up
chains that Christ has already broken. Don’t believe lies that Christ
has already exposed as false.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The devil is on the run. And you’re free to live like it.</td>

powers and authorities, he made a public spectacle of them, triumphing
over them by the cross.”</td>

<td>The cross is the turning point of all spiritual warfare. What looked
like defeat was actually the decisive victory.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Jesus didn’t just survive the enemy’s attack—He dismantled it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Disarmed.</strong> Every weapon the enemy had—sin, death,
condemnation, accusation—was stripped away. He has no legitimate claim.
No legal ground. No authority.</td>

<td><strong>Public spectacle.</strong> The victory wasn’t secret or
private. It was public. Visible. Undeniable. The powers of darkness were
put on display—defeated, humiliated, powerless.</td>

parade. Jesus didn’t just win—He celebrated. The cross wasn’t Plan B. It
was the plan. And it worked perfectly.</td>

bravado.</td>

power. Put on the full armor of God, so that you can take your stand
against the devil’s schemes.”</td>

God’s armor, not your own. And the call is to stand, not to fight for
ground you don’t have.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>You’re holding ground that’s already been won. Standing in victory
that’s already been secured. Resisting an enemy who’s already been
defeated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>This is spiritual warfare from rest. From confidence. From the
unforced rhythms of grace.</td>

Christ is victorious.</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Questions for the Journey:</strong> - Where are you still
fighting for victory instead of from victory? What battles feel
desperate? Where do you feel like you’re barely holding on? - What lies
has the enemy been whispering to you? Write them down. Be specific. Now
counter each lie with Scripture. Find the truth that exposes the lie. -
Read Colossians 2:15 slowly. What does it mean that Jesus “disarmed” the
enemy? What weapons does the enemy no longer have? - Are you giving the
devil too much credit—or not enough? What would a balanced approach look
like?</td>

</tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>## Key Themes</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>### 1. God’s Name is “I AM” – Present Tense</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>When Moses asked God for His name, God didn’t say “I was” or “I will
be.” He said:</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&gt; “I AM WHO I AM. This is what you are to say to the Israelites:
I AM has sent me to you.” &gt; &gt; — Exodus 3:14</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Present tense. Always.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>God isn’t just the God of your past—though He was faithful there. He
isn’t just the God of your future—though He’ll be faithful there
too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>He is the God of your present. Here. Now. In this moment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>This changes everything. Because if God is present-tense, then His
grace is present-tense too. Not stored up from yesterday. Not held back
until tomorrow. Here. Now. Sufficient for this moment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Paul writes: “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made
perfect in weakness” (2 Corinthians 12:9).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Sufficient. Not abundant for tomorrow. Not excess for next week.
Sufficient for today. For this moment. For this need.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>That’s all you need. And it’s enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>I spent years trying to secure tomorrow’s grace today. Planning
obsessively. Preparing for every contingency. Trying to control outcomes
that weren’t mine to control.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>And I was exhausted. Anxious. Never present.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>But when I learned to trust that God’s grace is sufficient for this
moment—and that tomorrow’s grace will come tomorrow—I began to
rest.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Not the rest of inactivity. The rest of presence. Being here.
Trusting now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>### 2. Matthew 6:34 – Today’s Troubles Are Sufficient</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Jesus addresses our tendency to borrow tomorrow’s worries:</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&gt; “Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry
about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.” &gt; &gt; —
Matthew 6:34</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>This isn’t fatalism. It’s wisdom.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Jesus isn’t saying troubles won’t come. He’s saying don’t add
tomorrow’s troubles to today’s load.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Today has enough to carry. Don’t make it heavier by adding what
hasn’t happened yet.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>I’m a worrier by nature. My mind races to worst-case scenarios. What
if this happens? What if that fails? What if everything falls
apart?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>And Jesus says: Stop. Come back to today. Today has enough. You
don’t need to carry tomorrow too.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>This is freedom. Real freedom. The freedom to engage fully with
what’s right in front of you instead of being paralyzed by what might
come.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Living in the moment doesn’t mean being oblivious to the future. It
means trusting that God will give you what you need when you need it.
That tomorrow’s grace will come tomorrow. That today’s grace is
sufficient for today.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Corrie ten Boom, who lived through the horrors of a Nazi
concentration camp, learned this truth:</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&gt; “Worry does not empty tomorrow of its sorrow. It empties today
of its strength.” &gt; — Corrie ten Boom, <em>Clippings from My
Notebook</em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>If anyone had reason to worry about tomorrow, it was Corrie. But she
discovered that borrowing tomorrow’s troubles only robs today of the
grace needed to live it well.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>### 3. The Manna Experience: Daily Bread</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>When Israel wandered in the wilderness, God provided manna every
morning. Daily bread. But the instruction was clear: gather only what
you need for today. Don’t try to hoard tomorrow’s provision.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Those who tried to keep extra found it rotting by morning. The
lesson: trust today’s provision for today. Tomorrow will have its
own.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>This is living in the moment. Not grasping for more than you need.
Not anxiously securing tomorrow. Just receiving today’s grace and
trusting tomorrow’s will come.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&gt; “Give us this day our daily bread.” &gt; &gt; — Matthew
6:11</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Not weekly bread. Not monthly bread. Daily bread.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Because grace is meant to be received in rhythm—morning by morning,
day by day, moment by moment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>### 4. Mary and Martha: The Better Choice</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The story of Mary and Martha (Luke 10:38-42) perfectly captures the
tension between doing and being, between productivity and presence.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Martha is distracted by preparations—good things, necessary things.
But she’s missing the moment. Missing the presence of Jesus right there
in her home.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Mary, on the other hand, sits at Jesus’ feet. Present. Attentive.
Fully engaged in the moment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Jesus’ words to Martha are gentle but clear:</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&gt; “Martha, Martha, you are worried and upset about many things,
but few things are needed—or indeed only one. Mary has chosen what is
better, and it will not be taken away from her.” &gt; &gt; — Luke
10:41-42</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The better choice: presence over productivity. Being over doing.
This moment with Jesus over the endless list of tasks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>This doesn’t mean tasks don’t matter. It means they’re not the
ultimate thing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The ultimate thing is being present to God’s presence. Being
attentive to this moment. Being fully here.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>I’ve been Martha most of my life. Busy. Productive. Distracted by
preparations. Always doing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>And I’ve missed moments. Beautiful, sacred, unrepeatable moments
because I was too busy to be present.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>I’m learning—slowly—to choose Mary’s part. To sit. To be. To let the
tasks wait while I’m fully present to what matters most.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>### 5. Practices of Presence</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Living in the moment isn’t automatic. It’s a practice. A discipline.
A set of habits that train you to be present.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Here are some practices that help:</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Breath prayers.</strong> Simple prayers that sync with your
breathing. “Lord Jesus Christ / have mercy on me” or “Be still / and
know.” They bring you back to this breath, this moment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Daily examen.</strong> Reviewing your day with God at the
end of each day. Noticing where you experienced His presence. Where you
were grateful. Where you struggled. This trains your attention to see
God in ordinary moments.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Sabbath rest.</strong> A weekly practice of stopping,
resting, and simply being. Teaching yourself that your worth isn’t tied
to your productivity.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Mindful activities.</strong> Walking without a podcast in
your ears. Eating without scrolling your phone. Having a conversation
without planning your response. Fully engaging with what you’re
doing.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Gratitude practice.</strong> Pausing to notice what’s here
instead of what’s missing. Giving thanks for this moment, this breath,
this grace.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>These aren’t magic. They’re training. Teaching yourself to notice
God’s presence in this moment. Anchoring yourself in the here and
now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>### 6. Fixing Your Eyes on Jesus</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Hebrews 12:1-2: “Let us run with perseverance the race marked out
for us, fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of
faith.”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The race is now. The moment is here. Fix your eyes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Not wandering eyes that constantly look around at what others have
or what might go wrong.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Not backward eyes that live in regret.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Not anxious eyes that strain to see the distant future.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Fixed eyes. On Jesus. On this moment. On the grace that’s present
right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Fixing your eyes isn’t passive. It’s an active discipline. A choice
you make moment by moment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Choosing to see this moment—not as a means to an end, but as the
place where God is present.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Choosing to focus on what you can control—your response, your
attitude, your obedience—and release what you can’t.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Choosing to look at Jesus instead of at the waves. At truth instead
of at fear. At grace instead of at guilt.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>## The Core Scripture Truth</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Hebrews 12:1-2</strong> - “Let us run with perseverance the
race marked out for us, fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and
perfecter of faith.”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>This passage captures the theology of living in the moment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The race isn’t in the past—those miles are behind you. The race
isn’t in the future—those miles haven’t arrived yet. The race is now.
This step. This breath. This moment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>And the key to running it well? Fixing your eyes on Jesus.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Not on the finish line so far you can’t see it. Not on the starting
line you’ve already left. On Jesus. Who is present. Here. Now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Pioneer and perfecter.</strong> Jesus has run this race. He
knows the way. And He’s with you—not just at the finish, but in this
moment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>This is the theological foundation for living in the moment: God is
not just the God of your past or your future. He is the God of your
present.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The great “I AM”—not “I was” or “I will be,” but “I AM.” Present
tense. Here. Now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&gt; “But he said to me, ‘My grace is sufficient for you, for my
power is made perfect in weakness.’” &gt; &gt; — 2 Corinthians 12:9</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Sufficient. Not abundant for tomorrow. Not stored up for next week.
Sufficient for today. For this moment. For this need.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>That’s all you need. And it’s enough.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>## Song Integration</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>I’d spent most of my life living anywhere but the present moment. My
mind was either in the past—replaying conversations, regretting
decisions, obsessing over what I should have said—or in the
future—catastrophizing outcomes, trying to control variables I couldn’t
control. The present? I was rarely there. Because the present required
me to feel, to be vulnerable, to acknowledge what was actually true
right now.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Anxiety was my constant companion. The low-grade, ever-present
anxiety of someone who can’t trust God with the moment in front of him.
I was always preparing, always planning, always trying to get ahead of
the next crisis. And I was exhausted.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>During a season of transition, when everything felt uncertain, a
friend asked: “What do you need right now? Not tomorrow. Right
now.”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>I couldn’t answer. I’d spent so long living in yesterday and
tomorrow that I’d forgotten how to be present to today.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>“Maybe the question you need to ask isn’t ‘What’s going to happen?’
but ‘Is God’s grace enough for this moment?’”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>I wanted to say yes. But honestly? I didn’t know if I believed
it.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>That’s when I began studying how God met people in their present
moments throughout Scripture. Adam and Eve weren’t given tomorrow’s
grace—they were given the garden that day. Abraham wasn’t promised the
full picture—he was called to trust God in that moment of promise.
Joseph wasn’t told the palace was coming—he was called to remain
faithful in the prison.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>The pattern was clear: God’s people have always been called to live
in the present tense. To trust that today’s grace is sufficient for
today.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>“This Moment is Enough” emerged from this study. I wanted to trace
redemption history through the lens of present-moment faithfulness—from
the garden through the flood, Abraham’s yes, Joseph’s redemption, all
the way to Jesus. And the refrain became my anthem: “We’re not promised
tomorrow, only the breath we breathe. Here in this moment, God’s mercy
never leaves.”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>This isn’t resignation. It’s liberation. I’m not promised tomorrow.
I don’t need tomorrow’s grace today. I just need this breath, this
moment, this sufficient grace right here. When you live from that
truth—when you really believe this moment is enough—anxiety loses its
grip. You’re free to be fully present, fully here, fully alive to the
grace that’s already present.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>## Key Takeaways</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>- <strong>God’s name is “I AM”—present tense, not past or
future.</strong> He meets you in this moment, not in yesterday’s regrets
or tomorrow’s anxieties. This moment is where His presence and grace are
available. - <strong>Sufficient grace for today is enough.</strong> Like
manna in the wilderness, God’s grace is given daily. Don’t hoard
yesterday’s grace or borrow tomorrow’s worry—receive what’s here, now. -
<strong>Presence over productivity.</strong> Mary chose the better
part—sitting at Jesus’ feet—while Martha stressed over serving. Being
with God matters more than doing for God. - <strong>Fix your eyes on
Jesus, not the waves.</strong> Hebrews 12:2 urges you to focus on Jesus,
the author and perfecter of faith. When you look at circumstances, you
sink. When you look at Him, you walk on water.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>## Practice: The Daily Examen</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>One of the most powerful practices for cultivating present-moment
awareness is the Daily Examen. Here’s a simple version:</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>### 1. Become aware of God’s presence Take a few deep breaths.
Acknowledge that God is present with you right now. Thank Him for this
moment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>### 2. Review the day with gratitude Walk through your day from
start to finish. Notice where you saw God’s presence. Where you
experienced grace. What brought joy, peace, or connection.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>### 3. Pay attention to your emotions What moments stirred strong
emotions—joy, anger, peace, anxiety? Don’t judge them. Just notice them.
These are often clues to where God is at work.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>### 4. Choose one feature of the day Pick one moment that stands
out. Sit with it. What was God doing in that moment? What was He
inviting you to?</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>### 5. Look toward tomorrow Not with anxiety, but with hope. What’s
one thing you’re facing tomorrow? How do you want to respond? What grace
do you need? Ask God for that grace. And trust that when tomorrow
becomes today, the grace will be there.</td>

is wasted. The truth that the devil is on the run.</p>
<p>All of it leading here. To this moment.</p>
<p>And you understand: every moment of the journey was preparation for
this. For learning to be present. To trust. To receive this moment—just
as it is—as enough.</p>
<p>Tomorrow will come. It always does. And when it arrives, it will
bring its own grace, its own challenges, its own moments.</p>
<p>But you don’t need tomorrow’s grace today. You just need this
moment’s grace. And it’s here. Sufficient. Complete. Enough.</p>
<p>You whisper the prayer that’s become your anthem: “This moment is a
gift of grace. This moment is enough.”</p>
<p>And you mean it. Because you’ve learned the secret: God is the great
I AM. Not I was. Not I will be. I AM.</p>
<p>Present tense. Here. Now. In this moment.</p>
<p>You take a breath—deep, full, grateful. And you step forward. Not
into tomorrow. Into this moment. The only moment that’s actually
yours.</p>
<p>And in this moment, you find everything you need: grace for this
breath, strength for this step, love for this person, wisdom for this
choice.</p>
<p>This moment is enough.</p>
<p>Not because it’s perfect. But because God is in it.</p>
<p>And God is always enough.</p>
<p>The journey continues. There are miles ahead. But you’re not walking
them yet. You’re walking this step. Living this breath. Trusting this
moment.</p>
<p>And this moment—this sacred, grace-filled, God-inhabited moment—is
enough.</p>
<p>More than enough.</p>
<p>It’s everything.</p>
