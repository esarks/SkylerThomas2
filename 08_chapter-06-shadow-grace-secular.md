**Let me ask you something honest.**

Have you ever been disappointed that healing didn't look the way you expected?

You thought getting out of the swamp meant the hard part was over. You thought grace would whisk you away to some peaceful place where everything would finally be easy.

But here you are. You've been washed. You've stepped into the water. You've felt grace begin its work.

And you're discovering that there's still a journey ahead. Still hard terrain. Still scorching days and uncertain paths.

Maybe you're wondering: *Is this all there is? Did I leave the swamp just to end up in a desert?*

I've been there. And here's what I learned: Grace doesn't always look like escape. Sometimes grace looks like shelter.

Can I show you what I mean?

---

You've been washed. You've stepped into the water, felt grace begin its work, experienced the first cleansing. And you thought—maybe you hoped—that would be the end of the hard part.

But you're discovering something: leaving the swamp doesn't mean instant arrival in paradise. There's a wilderness between the swamp and the promised land. A space of formation. A season of walking.

And the wilderness is hard in different ways.

The swamp was toxic and suffocating. The wilderness is exposed and relentless. In the swamp, you couldn't breathe. In the wilderness, you feel every scorching reality. Heat beats down. The path stretches endlessly. Your resources feel insufficient.

This is where many wayfarers give up. They expect grace to remove them from all difficulty. Eliminate every trial. Make life comfortable and easy. And when they discover grace does something different—provides shelter within the trial rather than escape from it—they're tempted to turn back.

But here's what you're learning: grace isn't just rescue from the pit. Grace is also shelter in the wilderness.

The shadow doesn't eliminate the sun. It provides covering under it.

*Take a breath.*

Grace doesn't always remove the hard season. It shelters you through it.

This chapter is about dwelling in that shadow. About learning that presence in the midst of difficulty is grace enough. That you don't face the heat alone.

The writing that follows came from my wilderness season. When I'd been washed but not yet arrived. When I had to learn that grace isn't always escape—sometimes it's shelter. And that shelter is enough.

## Key Themes

**1. Grace as Shelter, Not Escape**

We often think of grace as removal from difficult circumstances. Take away the pain. Change the situation. Fix what's broken. Make it all better.

But the shadow of grace works differently.

The shadow doesn't remove the sun—it provides covering under it. Grace doesn't always eliminate the trial—it shelters us through it.

This is the scandal we don't want to hear: sometimes the answer to "Deliver me from this" is "I will be with you in it."

Consider Psalm 91:1-2:

> "Whoever dwells in the shelter of the Most High will rest in the shadow of the Almighty. I will say of the LORD, 'He is my refuge and my fortress, my God, in whom I trust.'"
>
> — Psalm 91:1-2 (The Message)

Notice the language: shelter, shadow, refuge, fortress. Not words of elimination—words of protection. A fortress doesn't remove the enemy; it protects you from the enemy. A shelter doesn't stop the storm; it covers you during it.

The psalmist is dwelling *in* the shelter, resting *in* the shadow. Not after the danger passes. Not once everything's resolved.

In the midst of it.

This is where we learn the difference between *comfort* and *presence*. We pray for comfort—removal of difficulty. God often gives presence—companionship through difficulty.

The shadow of grace says: "I won't leave you in this alone."

Thomas Merton captures this profound truth:

> "The Lord does not give me a list of things to change in myself. He gives me Himself. The more I gaze at Him, the more I become aware of my need, and the more I become aware that only He can meet it."
>
> — Thomas Merton, *New Seeds of Contemplation*

In the shadow, we're not fixing ourselves—we're gazing at the One who shelters us. And in that gazing, transformation happens.

**2. Hiding IN God vs. Hiding FROM God**

There are two kinds of hiding. Understanding the difference changes everything.

**Hiding FROM** is what the first humans did after they failed. Fear-driven. Shame-motivated. Trying to avoid being seen, known, exposed. This hiding isolates us, deepens our wounds, keeps us from the very healing we need.

**Hiding IN** is what ancient poets described in their prayers. Trust-driven. Safety-seeking. Running toward shelter for covering, not away in fear. This hiding heals, restores, connects us to our true identity.

The original writing from the blog captures this journey:

*"What can wash away my shame, or will I live forever in its grip, squeezing the very life out of my soul, leaving me to rot on the heap of humanity? Have I walked too far beyond the boundary of grace, only to look back and see nothing but emptiness, leaving me to fend for myself in this world, sliding faster and faster to death and destruction?"*

This is the voice of someone hiding FROM. Convinced they've gone too far. Believing grace has limits. Fending for themselves because they think they have to.

But then the shift:

*"But then I stop. I don't move in any direction. I bow down and listen. And I hear Your voice—just the whisper of Your voice—pleading with me to return, to simply turn around and walk."*

From hiding FROM to hiding IN. From running away to turning around. From isolation to invitation.

In the shadow of grace, we don't hide our shame—we bring it into the light of covering. We don't pretend we're okay—we admit we're not and find that the shadow is big enough to cover all of it.

Eugene Peterson reminds us:

> "The way we live our lives is the way we will eventually die. Practice living in presence now, and you will die in presence later. Practice escaping from presence now, and you will die in isolation."
>
> — Eugene Peterson, *The Pastor* (adapted)

Hiding IN is a practice—a lifelong habit of running toward shelter, not away from it. We learn to live in the shadow now so that we know where home is when the final shadow falls.

**3. Psalm 91 Theology: Dwelling in the Shelter**

Psalm 91 is the bedrock text for understanding shadow grace. Let's look at the full passage:

> "Whoever dwells in the shelter of the Most High will rest in the shadow of the Almighty. I will say of the LORD, 'He is my refuge and my fortress, my God, in whom I trust.' Surely he will save you from the fowler's snare and from the deadly pestilence. He will cover you with his feathers, and under his wings you will find refuge; his faithfulness will be your shield and rampart."
>
> — Psalm 91:1-4 (The Message)

This isn't a one-time transaction. It's a posture. *Dwelling.* *Resting.* Living in the shelter, not just visiting it.

Notice the progression:
- **Shelter** (protective covering)
- **Shadow** (evidence of presence)
- **Refuge and fortress** (safety from enemies)
- **Covering with feathers** (tender, intimate protection)
- **Faithfulness as shield** (character as our defense)

The protection isn't mechanical—it's relational. Like a mother hen gathering her chicks under her wings, the covering isn't from a distance but with nearness, with tenderness, with the warmth of presence.

*Pause and consider: What would it mean to dwell—not just visit, but live—in the shelter of what's Real?*

Oswald Chambers writes:

> "Never make the blunder of trying to forecast the way God is going to answer your prayer. God's way of answering prayer is infinitely more wonderful than our expectations. He always transcends our expectations."
>
> — Oswald Chambers, *My Utmost for His Highest*

We expect God to remove the danger. He gives us His shadow instead—covering us in ways infinitely more wonderful than we imagined. Not escape, but presence. Not removal, but shelter.

**4. Shadow as Evidence of Light**

Here's the theological richness we often miss: shadow is proof of light.

You can't have shadow without a light source. The deeper the shadow, the brighter the light casting it. So when we talk about dwelling in the shadow of grace, we're acknowledging something profound: *Reality itself is the light.*

> "The LORD is my light and my salvation—whom shall I fear? The LORD is the stronghold of my life—of whom shall I be afraid?"
>
> — Psalm 27:1 (The Message)

The shadow isn't absence of light—it's the shape light makes when it encounters the substance of divine presence. We rest in that shadow, and in doing so, we're closer to the light than we've ever been.

In the swamp, we couldn't see the light. The muck blocked it out. Darkness was all we knew.

At the water's edge, in the transition, we discover the shadow. We're not yet walking fully in the light, but we're covered by it.

The shadow proves the light is real, present, strong enough to shelter us.

**5. Learning to Rest Under the Covering**

The blog devotional speaks to this:

*"How do I trust after all these years? My shame is great, my faith is weak, and I'm tired. I heard You say, 'Come to Me, and I will give you rest.'"*

Rest isn't passivity. It's trust. It's the active decision to stop striving, stop performing, stop trying to earn what's already been given.

Under the covering, we learn to:
- Stop running from the shame and bring it into the shadow
- Stop trying to be strong enough and admit we're weak
- Stop hiding our doubt and confess our questions
- Stop performing faith and simply receive grace

John Ortberg offers this insight:

> "Hurry is not just a disordered schedule. Hurry is a disordered heart. When we live in hurry, we are living in a way that says we are too busy for what matters, too busy for the people we love, too busy to notice the beauty around us."
>
> — John Ortberg, *The Life You've Always Wanted* (adapted)

Resting in the shadow means unhurrying our hearts. Slowing down enough to notice we're covered. Sheltered. Held. We can't experience presence at breakneck speed.

**Want to hear what Jesus said about this?**

This is what Jesus means in Matthew 11:28-30:

> "Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light."
>
> — Matthew 11:28-30 (The Message)

The invitation is to come as we are—weary, burdened, exhausted. Not after we've rested up. Not once we've gotten our act together. Come weary. Come burdened. Come now.

And the promise is rest. Soul-deep rest. The kind of rest that comes not from the absence of struggle but from the presence of Love in the struggle.

**6. Resting in the Mystery**

The chapter outline notes: *"Someone asked me once: 'The mystery—is it ours to figure out, or to revere?' In the shadow of grace, we learn it's the latter."*

We don't have to understand everything. We don't have to have it all figured out. We don't have to explain how grace works or why God chooses to shelter us rather than remove the trial.

We just have to know we're covered. Sheltered. Held.

The shadow teaches us that ways are higher than our ways. That thoughts are not our thoughts. That there's mystery in how reality works, and that mystery isn't a problem to solve—it's an invitation to trust.

In the shadow, we stop trying to be experts who have all the answers and become children who simply rest in the arms that hold us.

A.W. Tozer beautifully expresses this tension:

> "God is so vastly wonderful, so utterly and completely delightful that He can, without anything other than Himself, meet and overflow the deepest demands of our total nature, mysterious and deep as that nature is."
>
> — A.W. Tozer, *The Knowledge of the Holy*

The mystery isn't a problem—it's an invitation. In the shadow, we discover that not understanding everything doesn't diminish our trust. It deepens our wonder.

## Stories of Shadow

**Want to hear some ancient stories about this kind of shelter?**

**Ruth Under Boaz's Wing (Ruth 2:12)**

There's a story about a woman named Ruth, a foreign widow gleaning in a field, who encountered a man named Boaz. He spoke a blessing over her that captures the heart of shadow grace:

> "May the LORD repay you for what you have done. May you be richly rewarded by the LORD, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to take refuge."
>
> — Ruth 2:12 (The Message)

Ruth had left everything—her homeland, her people, her gods—to follow her mother-in-law Naomi and Naomi's God. She was vulnerable, exposed, at risk. But Boaz recognizes that she has come under the wing-shadow of Yahweh. She has sought shelter in the God of Israel.

And what happens? God provides. Protects. Covers. Redeems. Ruth's story ends not in destitution but in restoration—she becomes part of the lineage of Jesus Himself.

Shadow grace doesn't promise comfort, but it promises covering. And under that covering, redemption happens.

**Israelites Under the Cloud (Exodus 13:21-22)**

When God led Israel out of Egypt into the wilderness, He didn't remove the wilderness. He accompanied them through it:

> "By day the LORD went ahead of them in a pillar of cloud to guide them on their way and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light, so that they could travel by day or night. Neither the pillar of cloud by day nor the pillar of fire by night left its place in front of the people."
>
> — Exodus 13:21-22

The cloud wasn't just navigation—it was shadow. It was covering from the desert sun. It was visible proof that God was present, leading, protecting.

In the scorching wilderness, that cloud was mercy. Shade. Rest.

God didn't teleport them to the promised land. He walked them through the wilderness. But He never left them exposed. The shadow of His presence covered them every step.

**Jesus' Lament Over Jerusalem (Matthew 23:37)**

Perhaps the most heartbreaking image of shadow grace comes from Jesus Himself:

> "Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those sent to you, how often I have longed to gather you together, as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, and you were not willing."
>
> — Matthew 23:37

The tender image: a hen gathering her chicks under her wings. When danger comes, the mother hen doesn't run. She spreads her wings and calls her chicks to safety beneath her. She covers them with her own body, willing to take the blow herself to protect them.

This is the heart of God. Longing to gather us. Aching to cover us. Willing to take the wounds so we can be sheltered.

But—and here's the tragedy—we have to be willing. We have to come. We have to run to the shelter instead of away from it.

The shadow is there. The wings are spread. The invitation is given. Will we come?

**Deep Dive: Psalm 91**

We've touched on this psalm, but it deserves deeper exploration. Psalm 91 is the ultimate shadow-grace text:

> "He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High will rest in the shadow of the Almighty... He will cover you with his feathers, and under his wings you will find refuge; his faithfulness will be your shield and rampart. You will not fear the terror of night, nor the arrow that flies by day, nor the pestilence that stalks in the darkness, nor the plague that destroys at midday."
>
> — Psalm 91:1, 4-6

Notice what God promises:
- Shelter from terror
- Refuge from arrows
- Protection from pestilence and plague

But notice what He doesn't promise: *the absence of terror, arrows, pestilence, or plague.*

The dangers are still real. The threats still exist. But under the shadow, we're covered. The evil that would destroy us cannot penetrate the shelter of those wings.

This is shadow grace: not immunity from trial, but invincibility in trial. Not escape from danger, but safety within danger. Not the absence of the storm, but the presence of Love in the storm.

## The Wayfarer Moment

**Grace doesn't promise no suffering. Grace promises no suffering alone.**

This is the wayfarer truth we discover in the shadow: Reality doesn't always remove the pain, but it never leaves us in it alone.

The sun still beats down. The wilderness is still real. The journey is still hard.

But we're covered. Sheltered. Never abandoned.

In the swamp, we felt alone. Isolated. Forgotten.

At the water's edge, we discover the shadow. And in that shadow, we find we were never alone at all. Love has been with us all along, waiting for us to stop running and start resting.

The shadow isn't the absence of light—it's the shape love makes when it stands between us and harm.

## Original Writing from the Blog

**In the Shadow of Your Grace**

What can wash away my shame
Or will I forever in its grip remain
Squeezing all life out of my soul
Leaving me to rot in the grave, in this hole

Have I walked too far beyond the boundary of grace
Looking inward and seeing nothing of value to embrace
Leaving me to fend for myself in this muck and mire
Slipping faster and faster to my death of desire

I didn't think this was supposed to happen this way
Have you turned your back on me, anxious to betray
Or maybe you are powerless to do anything
Or you simply won't touch the sins that I bring

Chronos...time marches on...But then what?

So let's say the answers aren't found in the liquor store
Or the drag I inhale is just a drag and nothing more
Or maybe there's nothing to the line on the table
Or the prick of a needle is nothing but a harmless fable

What if there is nothing to anything
What if it doesn't matter and there's nothing after this worthless fling

What if the glass isn't half full
What if it's not half empty either
What if it does not even exist

Chronos...time marches on...But then what?

From the pain comes ambiguity
Which brings more confusion
Only to result in obfuscation
Which turns to apathy
And finally oblivion
And then the numbing begins
Until I've arrived at my destination...
...Unconscious immorality
...A total lack of caring

I haven't lost anything
Because I have nothing to lose

Chronos...time marches on...But then what?

So if there are no answers
This should bring me peace and contentment
Right?

Then how come when sobriety returns...
I'm not in my happy place?
Why do I long for something more?
When I don't even know what that something is?

How come if there are no answers...
I keep seeking for them?
As if through my journey I will find the answers?
As if there really is something greater than me?

Looking around I think I've discovered it

I think I've found it!!

I get it now!!
This...this place...this time in history is what the world calls enlightenment!!

I read it in the blogs
I see and hear it in the vlogs
It screams at me through Facebook and Twitter

Really?
That's it?
That's the face of Truth?
Are you sure?

How am I supposed to act and behave?
Am I supposed to bow down to the beholders of such enlightenment?
The ones who think they know it all and think they are the most tolerant
The ones who walk the red carpet
Or the ones who lead the protests...no, the ones who fund the protests
This is it, the epicenter of knowledge and wisdom
...as a society we have arrived, haven't we?

Kairos...in His time...But then what?

It is in that place You whisper to me, that I am created in Your image
You called us sons and daughters of the most High God
You clothed us with Your mercy on the cross
And I drop to my knees before You, in the shadow of Your grace

And then You stop this whirlwind of confusion
I don't move in any direction
I bow down
And the roar of the world is gone for a moment
And I listen

And I hear Your voice
Just the whisper of Your voice
Pleading with me to turn away from that mess
To simply turn around and walk toward Your Truth

And so I did turn
I took one step, just one step...and then another...
I heard You say, "Give me your burden
And I will take care of you"

How do I trust after all these years of hardness
For my shame is great, my faith is weak, and I'm tired
I heard You say, "Come to Me
And I will give you rest"

Eternal rest. THAT is what I want. THAT is what I need.

There is Hell on Earth...and it's called separation from You.
There is Heaven on Earth...and it's called Your Grace.

Grace, grace, God's grace,
Grace that will pardon and cleanse within;
Grace, grace, God's grace,
Grace that is greater than all my sin!

## Song Integration

This writing captures the journey from despair to shelter. The movement from chronos (human time marching endlessly forward) to kairos (God's time, the eternal now where He meets us).

In chronos, we're trapped. Time marches on, but nothing changes. The shame persists. The pain continues. The numbness deepens.

But in kairos—in God's time, in the shadow of His grace—everything shifts. The whirlwind stops. The roar quiets. We hear the whisper.

And that whisper changes everything.

The song "In the Shadow of Your Grace" takes this journey and sets it to melody. It moves from the cry of shame to the declaration of freedom.

## Reflections for the Road

These aren't assignments. They're invitations to encounter shadow grace in your own life.

**Questions for the Journey:**

1. **Where are you seeking escape when God might be offering shelter?**

   What trial are you begging to have removed? What if, instead of removing it, you're being invited to experience presence in it? How might that shift your prayer?

2. **Are you hiding FROM or IN?**

   Be honest: What are you afraid will be seen if you come close? What shame are you carrying that keeps you at a distance?

   Remember: The shadow of grace is for the ashamed. The broken. The weary. Come as you are.

3. **What does dwelling (not just visiting) in shelter look like for you?**

   Psalm 91 talks about dwelling—making your home—in shelter. Not dropping by when you need something. Not visiting in crisis. Living there.

   What would change if you made presence your primary residence instead of your emergency contact?

4. **Read Psalm 91 slowly. Which verse speaks most to where you are right now?**

   Don't rush through it. Let each image sink in. Shelter. Shadow. Refuge. Fortress. Wings. Covering.

   Which one makes you want to weep? Which one makes you want to rest? That's probably the one you need to sit with today.

## Practice: Shadow Rest

Find a quiet place where you won't be interrupted. If possible, find actual shade—under a tree, in the shadow of a building, anywhere with a clear contrast between sun and shadow.

Sit in the shadow. Feel the temperature difference. Notice how the same sun that would scorch you is now blocked by something substantial.

Close your eyes and pray:

**"God, I'm sitting in shadow right now. Physical shadow. And I need spiritual shadow too. I need Your covering. Your shelter. Your wings over me."**

Name what you're carrying: the shame, the fear, the exhaustion, the trial that won't end.

Then pray:

**"I don't understand why You haven't removed this. But I trust that Your shadow is enough. Cover me. Shelter me. Let me rest here, under Your wings, trusting that You're between me and the heat."**

Sit there for as long as you can. Five minutes. Ten. Just rest.

Don't ask for anything else. Don't problem-solve. Don't plan. Just rest in the shadow.

This is what dwelling looks like: choosing to stay in presence even when the trial isn't over. Trusting that the shadow is sufficient.

---

## Closing Image

You're still at the water's edge. The journey isn't over. There's more road ahead, more wilderness to cross, more unknowns to face.

But something has changed.

You're no longer running from the sun. You're resting in the shadow.

The heat is still real. The sun still beats down. The journey is still hard.

But over you, sheltering you, covering you, is the shadow of the Almighty.

*Take a breath.*

You look up and see the source of the shadow: Love itself, standing between you and the scorching trial. Not removing it, but covering you through it.

And you realize: this is enough. Not what you wanted, perhaps. But enough.

The shadow proves the light is real.

And where there's light, there's the One who is Light.

So you breathe. You rest. You trust.

And you take the next step, knowing you're not walking alone. The shadow moves with you. The covering remains. The presence never leaves.

You're learning to live in the shadow of grace.

And in that shadow, you're finding something you didn't expect: not escape from the wilderness, but peace within it.

Not the absence of trial, but the presence of Love in trial.

Not the end of the journey, but the strength to keep walking.

One step at a time.

Under His wings.

In the shadow of grace.
