**Before you read this chapter, I want you to know something.**

If you're still reading, you're already curious. Maybe skeptical, but curious. That's enough.

This chapter is going to talk about the swamp—that stuck place where you've been living, maybe for years. It's going to name some hard truths. It's going to introduce you to some people who've been there and some ancient wisdom that speaks to it.

And at the end, I'm going to ask you to consider something. Just consider it—not commit to it, not sign up for anything. Just open your mind to a possibility you might not have thought about before.

A possibility that the stirring you feel, the restlessness, the longing—might be more than random. Might be something, or Someone, calling to you.

You don't have to believe it yet. You don't have to understand it all. You just have to keep reading.

Can you do that?

---

**One more thing about the music.**

Maybe you're not ready for it yet. I know it's going to have a spiritual slant to it. But just start listening.

Because I think you'll find much of it is a desperate plea for more than just my own limitations. It's a plea for something greater.

And that something greater—I hope you'll discover through this journey—is God's love in a way you may have never considered.

---

You know you're in the swamp when you start defending it.

When someone asks if you're okay and you snap back, "I'm fine." When a friend gently suggests you might need help and you list all the reasons why your situation is different, more complicated, not what it looks like from the outside. When you catch yourself explaining why you have to stay—why leaving isn't an option, why this is just how life is, why everyone else simply doesn't understand.

The swamp doesn't announce itself with a sign. It's not marked on any map. You don't wake up one day and think, "Ah yes, I've arrived at my personal hell." It creeps in. A compromise here. A numbing behavior there. A toxic relationship you've learned to navigate. A performance you maintain because it's easier than being honest. A shame you carry that's become so familiar you can't imagine living without its weight.

And here's what makes the swamp so dangerous: you get functional in it. You learn to breathe the toxic air. You figure out where to step to avoid sinking deeper. You develop a routine, a rhythm, a way of existing that looks normal from the outside while you're dying on the inside.

This chapter is about the moment you stop defending and start seeing. When the explanations fall away and you're left with the raw truth: this place was never meant to sustain life. And you can't keep pretending it does.

The writing that follows came from my moment of seeing. Not in a flash of revelation, but in a slow, painful recognition that I'd built a life in a place that was killing me. And the first step toward freedom wasn't a grand gesture—it was simply admitting the truth: This is my swamp. And I'm drowning in it.

## Key Themes

**1. The Geography of Disconnection**

The swamp is where connection dies. From yourself. From others. From what's real and true. In the swamp, you stop asking if you're loved and start wondering if you're even lovable. You stop reaching out and start shutting down.

Brené Brown, whose research has explored human connection for decades, puts it this way:

> "Connection is why we're here; it is what gives purpose and meaning to our lives. The power of connection and the fear of disconnection have driven human behavior since the beginning of time."
>
> — Brené Brown, *Daring Greatly*

Connection is oxygen for the soul. Cut it off long enough, and something inside you begins to suffocate.

That's what the swamp does—it suffocates connection. And without connection, you slowly die inside.

Let's be honest about what the swamp actually is:

Dark water, murky and opaque. You can't see the way out. The muck clings to you, pulls at you. Everything feels heavy—your clothes, your limbs, your thoughts. And you can taste it in the back of your throat. Bitter. Like swallowing failure.

This isn't just depression (though it might be that too). This is years of performing instead of being. Conversations that ricochet off walls. Connection that feels like clocking in. Community that tastes like judgment. Meaning that stopped being a gift and became a weight you can't carry anymore.

**2. The Abyss Within**

Ever feel like there's a bottomless hole inside you? Like no matter what you achieve, acquire, or accomplish, it's never enough?

One writer, working through his own darkness, described it this way:

> "There is a deep hole in your being, like an abyss. You will never succeed in filling that hole, because your needs are inexhaustible... Since the hole is so deep and your anguish so total, you run away from it, afraid that you will fall into it. But you cannot run away from yourself."
>
> — Henri Nouwen, *The Inner Voice of Love*

He wrote this in a private journal, never intending to publish it. Just trying to talk himself through the darkest season of his life. That bottomless ache that no amount of activity, achievement, or performance can fill.

There's an ancient song—thousands of years old—that gives voice to this experience. It's the only one that begins and ends in darkness:

> "I am overwhelmed with troubles and my life draws near to death... You have put me in the lowest pit, in the darkest depths... Why do you reject me and hide your face from me?... The darkness is my closest friend."
>
> — Psalm 88 (The Message)

The song never resolves. It ends with "darkness is my closest friend." No neat bow. No triumphant turnaround. Just brutal honesty.

Sometimes lament without resolution IS the truth. Sometimes darkness IS the companion.

And that honesty? It matters.

**3. The Death of the Impostor**

Ever feel like you're playing a role? Like the person people see isn't really you?

Someone gave a name to this:

> "The impostor is the false self shaped by others' expectations rather than authentic inner promptings. The impostor thrives in places that reward the compliant, the performing, the image-maintaining. The impostor whispers: 'If they knew the real you—the doubting, struggling, messy you—they'd reject you.' So you hide. You perform. You maintain the image. And you die inside while looking alive outside."
>
> — Brennan Manning, *Abba's Child*

The impostor.

That was me. Not a liar, exactly. Just a performer. Shaped by what others expected. Driven by the hunger for approval. Terrified of being truly known.

I was the leader who felt nothing. The mentor dispensing advice I didn't believe. The person wielding wisdom like props while drowning in doubt.

*Pause and consider: Who is your impostor? What mask are you wearing?*

There's an ancient teaching that flips this whole performance thing on its head:

> "Blessed are the poor in spirit... Blessed are those who mourn... Blessed are the meek... Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness..."
>
> — Matthew 5:3-6 (The Message)

Translation: blessed are the spiritually bankrupt, the honest grievers, the powerless, the desperate.

The swamp is where the impostor dies.

I thought that was tragedy. I didn't yet know it was mercy.

**4. Why We Stay Stuck**

I stayed stuck for reasons I barely admitted to myself.

Fear whispers: *What if you cry for help and no one answers? Better the swamp you know than the silence you don't.*

Shame whispers: *Functional people don't feel like this. If they knew the real you, they'd be horrified.*

Exhaustion whispers: *You're too tired to move. The swamp is killing you, but at least it's predictable.*

Identity whispers: *If you're not the strong one, the competent one, the leader—who are you?*

One spiritual teacher explains why the swamp is so exhausting:

> "We cannot transform ourselves. We cannot make ourselves into the people we need to be. Every self-help program, every technique, every discipline—pursued as self-salvation—will fail. Not because the practices are bad, but because we're asking them to do something they cannot do: save us. Grace is not opposed to effort; it is opposed to earning. You cannot earn transformation by trying harder. But you can position yourself where transformation happens."
>
> — Dallas Willard, *The Great Omission*

Here's the swamp's hidden curriculum: the self-salvation project is a lie.

I'd been trying to transform myself—more discipline, more service, more belief, more performance. I was exhausted because I was demanding from effort what only surrender can deliver.

**5. The Soul's Restless Hunger**

Ever feel like nothing satisfies? Like you keep searching for something but you don't even know what it is?

An ancient writer, sixteen hundred years ago, described it perfectly:

> "You have made us for yourself, O Lord, and our hearts are restless until they rest in you. I carried my shattered self through streets and squares looking for something to fill the void. I tried honor, I tried pleasure, I tried philosophy, I tried religion. I threw myself into each with desperate intensity, hoping it would finally satisfy. But nothing did. Nothing could... The restlessness is a mercy. It's the soul refusing to settle for substitutes."
>
> — Augustine of Hippo, *Confessions*

The swamp is full of this gnawing ache—nothing works anymore. Not willpower. Not achievement. Not service.

But what if that restlessness is actually healthy? What if your soul is refusing to settle for worthless substitutes?

**6. The First Cry for Help**

This is where hope flickers. Barely. Because even the cry for help is a form of healing.

"If there's anything real out there—I can't do this anymore."

Not eloquent. Not sophisticated. But honest. And honesty—raw, desperate, unvarnished honesty—is the native language of transformation.

This is authenticity stripped to bone: *I can't. Help.*

One teacher talks about two kinds of suffering:

> "There are two kinds of suffering: necessary suffering and unnecessary suffering. Unnecessary suffering is when you fight reality, blame others, stay in victimhood, and refuse to let the pain teach you. It's suffering that embitters rather than transforms. Necessary suffering is when you enter the pain consciously, asking 'What is this teaching me? How is this changing me? Where is truth in this?' The same suffering can be either necessary or unnecessary. The difference isn't the suffering itself; it's how you engage it. Necessary suffering breaks you open. And that breaking is grace, because only the broken can be filled."
>
> — Richard Rohr, *Falling Upward*

The cry for help—*I can't do this anymore*—marks the shift from unnecessary to necessary suffering.

You stop fighting reality and start asking what it's trying to teach you.

## Stories of the Swamp

Want to know something interesting? This swamp thing isn't new. People have been stuck in swamps for thousands of years. And some of their stories might sound familiar.

**The Ancient Captives**

There's a story about a group of people stuck for four hundred years. Generational swamp. They couldn't free themselves.

So they groaned. They cried out.

And the response?

> "I've taken a good, long look at the affliction of my people in Egypt. I've heard their cries for deliverance from their slave masters; I know all about their pain. And now I have come down to help them, pry them loose from the grip of Egypt..."
>
> — Exodus 3:7-8 (The Message)

Not "try harder." Not "fix yourself first."

*I have come down to help them.*

**The Man in the Fish**

Then there's this wild story about a guy in the ultimate swamp—literally inside a fish.

From that impossible place, he prays:

> "In my distress I called out, and was answered. From deep in the realm of the dead I called for help, and was heard... Those who cling to worthless idols turn away from love... Salvation comes from beyond ourselves."
>
> — Jonah 2:2-9 (The Message)

Even from inside a fish, he names what he'd been doing: "clinging to worthless idols."

The swamp is where you discover that everything you've been clinging to is worthless. Every substitute. Every prop. Every false salvation.

**The Fugitive in the Cave**

And there's the fugitive hiding in a cave, writing this:

> "I cry aloud; I lift up my voice for mercy. I pour out my complaint; I tell my trouble... Look and see, there is no one at my right hand; no one is concerned for me. I have no refuge; no one cares for my life..."
>
> — Psalm 142 (The Message)

He doesn't clean up his prayer. Doesn't spiritualize his pain. Doesn't pretend.

That honesty—that raw vulnerability—IS courage. The complaint IS the prayer.

## The Core Truth

Here's where I need to be straight with you about something from scripture.

There's a letter written two thousand years ago that gets quoted a lot, but usually just one line: "While we were still broken, love died for us."

But here's the full passage, and it matters:

> "You see, at just the right time, when we were still powerless, love came for the lost. Very rarely will anyone die for a righteous person, though for a good person someone might possibly dare to die. But love demonstrates itself in this: While we were still in our broken patterns, restoration came for us. Since we have now been made right, how much more shall we be saved through this. For if, while we were opposed to what's real, we were reconciled through death, how much more, having been reconciled, shall we be saved through life!"
>
> — Romans 5:6-10 (The Message)

Four words describe where we were when love came: powerless, lost, broken, opposed.

That's the swamp. No ability to save yourself (powerless). No spiritual credentials (lost). Failing morally and spiritually (broken). Actively opposed to truth (enemies).

The text doesn't soften it. It names it. And then drops the bomb: WHILE we were still in that state—love came for us.

Not after we cleaned up. Not once we got our act together. Not when we finally mustered enough strength.

**While we were still.**

Swamp-dwellers. Muck-covered. Mid-mess.

This is why scripture is different from any other approach. It doesn't start with "get yourself together first." It starts with "you can't, and that's exactly when love shows up."

This is the scandal:

> "The broken human is not simply an imperfect creature who needs improvement: we are rebels who must lay down our arms. Laying down your arms, surrendering, saying you are sorry, realizing that you have been on the wrong track and getting ready to start life over again from the ground up—that is the only way out of our 'hole.' Here is the scandal and the glory: Love comes to you in the muck. Not after you've cleaned yourself up. Not once you've proven yourself worthy. In the muck. While you're still a rebel. While you're still in the swamp. That's where healing finds you."
>
> — C.S. Lewis, *Mere Christianity* (adapted)

Here's the swamp's hidden gift: it forces surrender. I'd tried everything else—more discipline, more service, more belief, more performance, even more "morality" (being good). Nothing worked. So I did the only thing left: I laid down my arms.

And here's the glory: that's exactly when healing shows up. Not after you've cleaned yourself up. In the muck. Mid-swamp. While you're still broken and messy and desperate.

There's an ancient invitation—words spoken by Jesus himself—that speaks directly to this:

> "Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light."
>
> — Matthew 11:28-30 (The Message)

*Come, all you who are weary and burdened.*

Burned out. Swamp-stuck. Performance-exhausted.

Maybe that's you. I know it was me.

And the voice says: Come.

Not "clean up first." Not "try harder." Just come. As you are. Muck and all.

And I will give you rest.

## The Wayfarer Moment

**Admitting "I'm not okay" is the doorway to healing. The swamp is where pretending goes to die.**

For years, I'd been pretending. Performing. Image-maintaining. And it was soul-crushing. Exhausting. Unsustainable.

The swamp strips away performance. When you're drowning, you stop caring about optics. You just want oxygen.

And that's exactly where healing begins.

The ancient poet modeled this vulnerability, written from a cave where he was hiding for his life. Brutally honest. Vulnerable. No pretending. No performance. He names isolation, abandonment, desperation.

The swamp forces vulnerability. You can't maintain the image anymore. You can't perform. You can't pretend.

It feels like death.

But it's actually courage.

This is how you become truly known. And only the truly known can be truly loved.

That admission—that raw honesty—isn't defeat.

It's the doorway.

## Original Writing from the Blog

THIS is my swamp…

My skin is thick and tough…
… so that I no longer have to be vulnerable to the pain that surrounds me.

My fighting skills are honed and advanced…
… so that I can aggressively and fiercely shred any foe that attacks me.

I can submerge and hide for long periods of time…
… to avoid uncomfortable confrontation.

I can adapt to my surroundings here in my swamp…
…so that I can be…
…unaffected
…unmoved
…unshaken
…un-convicted

It's cold here in my swamp…
But my thick skin insulates me from the outside cold…
…In fact I even prefer it to be cold and dark…
…It fits my present state of disposition…

Yes… this is my swamp…
…Where I can be alone…
…Where I'm constantly in the dark…
…Where I'm numb to the world around me…
…Where I can be angry… bitter… and unforgiving…

But I long for something more…

When I see that warm sun reflecting light on the water
When I feel the warmth from the sun cascading on my skin
When I start to remember that it felt good to feel something
I can't help but want to climb out of my swamp…

…But then I look down into the murky muddy waters…
And I realize I've been here a long time…
And I'm covered with swamp mud all over me…
And I stink…

I get a glimpse of cleansing… but then
I also remember all the mud I've been wallowing in…
And I realize how much I stink…
And I feel too ashamed to leave my swamp…

Perhaps if I work REALLY REALLY REALLY hard at getting all this mud off of me…
Perhaps then… then maybe I could leave my swamp…

## Song Integration

**The Season of Stuck:**

The song "I Will Rise" emerged from the tension between where I was and where I longed to be. I was functional in the swamp—I'd learned to survive there. But surviving isn't the same as living, and deep down, I knew it.

The song doesn't skip past the swamp. It starts there:

*"I built these walls, I learned to fight, kept my heart locked up so tight..."*

That captured my reality. Not just a bad day. Not just a rough season. I'd been there so long I'd adapted to survive.

**The Core Tension:**

The verses acknowledge the swamp—the feeling of being buried, the weight, the inability to see a way out. But the chorus insists on something that hasn't happened yet:

*"I will rise, I will stand, I will lift my voice again..."*

This isn't positive thinking. It's not "fake it till you make it." It's the deep human intuition that this isn't the end of the story. That the swamp isn't the final word.

Viktor Frankl, a psychiatrist who survived Auschwitz, wrote about this human capacity:

> "Everything can be taken from a person but one thing: the last of the human freedoms—to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way."
>
> — Viktor Frankl, *Man's Search for Meaning*

Frankl experienced the ultimate swamp—a Nazi death camp. And even there, he discovered this freedom.

The song is that choice. Before the rescue. Before the healing. Before the transformation.

The choice to believe rising is possible—even when you're still stuck.

**Why the Song Matters:**

The swamp wants you to believe you'll never rise. That you're too far gone. Too damaged. Too stuck. Too covered in muck.

The song says: not yet, but I will.

That's not denial. That's defiance. It's the soul refusing to accept the swamp as permanent.

Brené Brown, a researcher who's spent decades studying shame and vulnerability, writes:

> "Owning our story can be hard but not nearly as difficult as spending our lives running from it. Embracing our vulnerabilities is risky but not nearly as dangerous as giving up on love and belonging and joy—the experiences that make us the most vulnerable. Only when we are brave enough to explore the darkness will we discover the infinite power of our light."
>
> — Brené Brown, *The Gifts of Imperfection*

Brown's research confirms what scripture has been saying for millennia: vulnerability is the path to healing. Running from our story keeps us stuck. Owning it sets us free.

"I Will Rise" is the song of someone exploring the darkness. Naming it. Owning it. And declaring: this isn't where my story ends.

## Song Lyrics: "I Will Rise"

**[Verse 1]**
I built these walls, I learned to fight,
Kept my heart locked up so tight.
Hid my fear behind a smile,
But I've been sinking all the while.

**[Pre-Chorus]**
I hear You calling through the night,
A voice so strong, yet full of light.
You pull me close, You draw me higher,
Out of the swamp, into the fire.

**[Chorus]**
I won't stay where shadows grow,
Where my heart turns cold, where the dark winds blow,
I'm stepping out, I'm choosing life,
Leaving the swamp for the morning light.
Oh, I will rise… I will rise.

**[Verse 2]**
I made a home in sinking ground,
Afraid to leave, afraid to drown.
But chains aren't homes, and wounds don't heal
When I resist the love you reveal
The fear, the shame, the weight I've known,
You call me out, You lead me home.

**[Pre-Chorus]**
I hear You calling through the night,
A voice so strong, yet full of light.
You pull me close, You draw me higher,
Out of the swamp, into the fire.

**[Chorus]**
I won't stay where shadows grow,
Where my heart turns cold, where the dark winds blow,
I'm stepping out, I'm choosing life,
Leaving the swamp for the morning light.
Oh, I will rise… I will rise.

**[Bridge]**
I see the road, I see the dawn,
And though I shake, I'll carry on.
No more hiding, no more chains,
Your grace is stronger than my pain!

**[Final Chorus]**
I won't stay where shadows grow,
Where my heart turns cold, where the dark winds blow,
I'm stepping out, I'm choosing life,
Leaving the swamp for the morning light.
Oh, I will rise… I will rise.

**[Outro]**
No turning back, I'm walking free,
The past is gone, Your love in me.
The past is gone, Your love in me.
Oh, I will rise… I will rise.

## Reflections for the Road

These aren't questions to answer quickly. They're invitations to be honest.

**Questions for the Journey:**

1. **What is your swamp?**

   Not metaphorically. Specifically. Where are you stuck? What patterns have you normalized? What pain have you learned to live with?

   Name it. Out loud if you can. In writing if you must. But name it.

2. **How long have you been defending your swamp?**

   What explanations do you give? What justifications? "It's not that bad." "Everyone struggles." "I'm handling it."

   What would happen if you stopped defending and started being honest?

3. **What would it cost you to admit "I'm not okay"?**

   What identity would you lose? What image would crack? What expectations would you fail to meet?

   And here's the harder question: What is staying in the swamp already costing you?

4. **Who knows the real you—the swamp-dwelling, muck-covered, struggling you?**

   If no one knows, why not? If someone knows, what changed when you let them see?

   The impostor thrives in isolation. Authenticity requires witness.

## Practice: The Five-Minute Honest Conversation

Find a quiet space. Set a timer for five minutes.

And just be honest. Out loud if possible. In writing if necessary. In prayer if that's your language. In conversation with yourself if not.

Don't edit yourself. Don't soften it. Don't try to make it sound better. Just be honest.

Talk about the swamp. How long you've been there. What it feels like. What you're angry about, confused about, afraid of.

Talk about the performance. The exhaustion. The isolation. The shame.

Say "Help."

When the timer goes off, breathe.

*Take a breath.*

You've just spoken the most important truth: the real one.

The universe hears. Not because it was eloquent. Because it was true. And truth is the language healing speaks.

---

## Closing Image

You're still in the swamp. Let's be honest. This isn't the rescue chapter. This is the honesty chapter. The naming chapter. The cry-for-help chapter.

The swamp hasn't vanished. You're still stuck. Feet still in muck. Water still murky. Way out still unclear.

But something shifted.

You've looked up.

For the first time in months—maybe years—you've stopped looking down at the muck, stopped looking around at the darkness, stopped looking inward at the failure.

You've looked up.

And you see something you haven't seen in a long time: light. Just a glimmer. Just a hint. Filtering through the canopy. Weak, maybe. But real.

You can't see the source yet. You can't see the full picture. You can't see the path out.

But you can see that the swamp isn't all there is. There's something beyond it. Above it. Outside it.

And in that moment—that brief, fragile, barely-there moment—hope flickers.

Not rescue yet. Just realization.

*You can't save yourself.*

And maybe—just maybe—that's okay. Maybe admitting "I can't" is the doorway to discovering "there is a way."

---

**But here's what I want you to consider.**

Just for a moment. You don't have to commit to anything. You don't have to believe it all right now. Just consider the possibility.

What if that stirring you feel—that restlessness, that longing, that whisper you've been hearing in the quiet moments—what if it's not just last night's pizza? What if it's not your imagination making things up?

What if it's actually something calling to your soul?

What if there's a power greater than yourself—one you might not have considered before—that's been trying to get your attention?

Not a cosmic force. Not karma. Not the universe.

LOVE.

An infinite sort of love that you can't fully comprehend just yet. A love so vast, so personal, so relentless that it won't leave you alone in your swamp. A love that knows your name. That sees you in the muck. That isn't repelled by your mess.

What if God—the Almighty, the Creator, the Source of all that is—is actually capable of calling out to your soul?

What if He's calling right now?

I'm not asking you to believe it all. I'm not asking you to sign up for anything. I'm just asking you to consider: what if?

What if the ache you feel is your soul recognizing a voice it was made to hear?

What if the restlessness is mercy—Love refusing to let you settle for substitutes?

What if the swamp itself—this dark, desperate place—is exactly where Love meets you?

The swamp is still real. The struggle is still real. The pain is still real.

But so is the light.

And so is the Love calling your name.

You've looked up.

And maybe—just maybe—you're starting to hear.

---

**And here's the beautiful part.**

You don't have to go through some ritual to access this Love. You don't have to take a class. You don't have to learn the right words or master some technique. You don't have to clean yourself up first.

You can simply cry out. Right now. Right where you are.

"Help me."

That's it. Two words. Not eloquent. Not religious. Just honest.

You can do that any time you wish. In the swamp. In the muck. In the middle of your mess. Right here, even as you read these words.

And know this: His Love is simply waiting for you.

Not judging. Not demanding. Not requiring you to have it all figured out first.

Just waiting.

Ready to meet you exactly where you are—swamp mud and all.

Even now.

Especially now.

That changes everything.
